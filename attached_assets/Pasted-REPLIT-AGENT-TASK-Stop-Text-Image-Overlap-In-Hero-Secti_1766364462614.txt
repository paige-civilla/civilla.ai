REPLIT AGENT TASK: Stop Text/Image Overlap In Hero Sections (Responsive Containment Fixes) — DO NOT TOUCH NAVBARS

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- DO NOT edit:
  - client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
  - client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx

GOAL
Across Home + key marketing pages, ensure hero boxes and section blocks reflow cleanly at different screen widths:
- No text overlays images
- No headings overlap other text
- Images stay inside their containers
- Cards/columns wrap without crossing boundaries

PHASE 1 — IDENTIFY OVERLAP CAUSES (SEARCH)
1) Search for absolute positioning / z-index / transforms in marketing components:
rg -n "absolute|fixed|sticky|z-|translate-|top-|left-|right-|bottom-|\-mt-|\-mb-|\-ml-|\-mr-" client/src/pages client/src/components

2) Focus on these likely hero/section files if they exist:
- client/src/pages/Home.tsx
- client/src/components/Hero*.tsx
- client/src/components/ClaritySection.tsx
- client/src/components/ToolsSection.tsx
- client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx
- client/src/components/CTASection.tsx
- client/src/pages/HowCivillaWorks.tsx

PHASE 2 — APPLY STANDARD “CONTAINMENT” FIXES (MINIMAL CHANGES)
For each hero/section where overlap occurs, apply the following rules:

A) Ensure parent containers are positioned normally
- If a section uses any absolutely positioned children, add `relative` to the section wrapper.

B) Prevent flex/grid children from overflowing into each other
- On any flex/grid child that contains text, add Tailwind: `min-w-0`
- If a two-column layout exists, ensure the text column has `min-w-0` and the image column has `min-w-0`.

C) Ensure images cannot float over text
- Any <img> should have:
  - `w-full h-full object-cover` OR `object-contain`
  - and be placed inside a wrapper with an explicit sizing rule:
    - e.g. `aspect-[4/3]` (or an existing height constraint)
- If the image is currently absolutely positioned over content, change it to normal flow (remove absolute) unless it’s purely decorative background.

D) Make columns stack on small screens
- Any 2-column hero layout must have:
  - `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` OR `flex flex-col md:flex-row`
- Ensure there is a `gap-*` between columns so they don’t collide.

E) Remove negative margins/transforms that cause collisions on small screens
- If any `-mt-*`, `translate-y-*`, or z-index hacks cause overlap at small widths, gate them behind md+:
  - Example: change `-mt-10` to `md:-mt-10`
  - change `translate-y-8` to `md:translate-y-8`

PHASE 3 — VERIFY IN RESPONSIVE PREVIEW
Check these widths at minimum:
- 375px (iPhone)
- 768px (tablet)
- 1024px (desktop)

Verify:
- Home hero: image never overlaps headline/subhead
- Section hero boxes: headings and body text never overlap
- CTASection: buttons/text remain within card
- Tools/Steps: no collision after accordion expansion
- No horizontal scroll introduced

REPORT BACK
- List each file changed + line ranges
- For each fix, note the cause (absolute/z-index, missing min-w-0, image sizing, negative margin)
- Confirm navbars were not modified
