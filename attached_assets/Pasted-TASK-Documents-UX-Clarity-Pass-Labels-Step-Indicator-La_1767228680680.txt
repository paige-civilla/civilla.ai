TASK: Documents UX Clarity Pass (Labels + Step Indicator + Layout Separation)

AUTONOMY: LOW
SCOPE: UI COPY + SMALL LAYOUT ONLY (NO BACKEND CHANGES)
GOAL:
Make the Documents experience understandable to non-developers by clearly separating:
1) Draft editing
2) Review & confirm
3) Court-formatted DOCX output
and by renaming confusing labels/buttons.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change any API routes or backend logic
- Do NOT change existing data models
- Do NOT remove existing features
- Keep current styling system (Tailwind/shadcn) and Civilla colors
- Minimal refactor: prefer small targeted edits in the existing page
- Ensure no TS errors and no console errors

PRIMARY FILE:
- client/src/pages/AppDocuments.tsx

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

A) RENAME TABS (COPY ONLY)
1) Find the Tabs triggers for the two sections:
   - Change "My Documents" to "Draft Documents"
   - Change "Download History" to "Court Filings (DOCX)"
2) Keep the tab values the same (do not change internal keys). Only change visible text.

B) RENAME MAIN ACTION BUTTON (COPY ONLY)
1) Locate the button that opens the court DOCX flow (currently something like "Download DOCX (Court Format)" or similar).
2) Change its visible label to:
   "Prepare Court Filing (DOCX)"
3) Add a small helper text directly under or near this button (font-sans text-xs/ text-sm, muted) that says:
   "Review details, confirm date and role, then generate a court-formatted DOCX."
4) Do not change the click handler or modal behavior.

C) ADD STEP INDICATOR INSIDE THE REVIEW & EDIT MODAL (SMALL UI ADD)
1) Inside the existing Review & Edit modal DialogContent, at the very top under the DialogHeader (or within it),
   add a small non-interactive step indicator that visually shows:
   "Draft → Review → Court Filing"
   with a secondary line:
   "Step 2 of 3"
   and a subtle hint:
   "You are reviewing details before generating the DOCX."
2) Make it lightweight: a small bordered pill or muted row; no new components required.
3) Must not change any modal logic or state transitions.

D) VISUALLY SEPARATE DRAFTS VS FILINGS (LIGHT RESTRUCTURE ONLY)
1) Keep Tabs, but ensure each tab content has:
   - A section header (h2 or similar) matching the tab label
   - A 1-sentence description:
     Draft Documents description:
       "Working versions you can edit anytime. These are not court-formatted."
     Court Filings (DOCX) description:
       "Previously generated court-formatted DOCX versions you can re-download."
2) Do NOT change how documents load. Only wrap existing lists with these headers and descriptions.

E) OPTIONAL: BUTTON MICRO-COPY IN LIST ITEMS (IF EASY, NO LOGIC CHANGE)
If the draft list has an action that generates DOCX, rename the visible label (only the text) to:
- "Prepare Court Filing"
If the history list has a redownload action, rename visible label to:
- "Re-download DOCX"
Do not change handlers.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (YOU MUST VERIFY):
1) Documents page renders with no errors
2) Tabs show: "Draft Documents" and "Court Filings (DOCX)"
3) Main action says "Prepare Court Filing (DOCX)" and shows helper text
4) Opening the Review & Edit modal shows the step indicator and "Step 2 of 3"
5) No backend changes, no route changes, no API changes
6) Build passes

DELIVERABLE:
Reply with:
- Exact file(s) edited
- Line ranges for each change (A, B, C, D, optional E)
- Confirmation that only UI copy/layout changed and all tests above pass
