TASK: Slice 2B — Evidence Metadata + Hard Delete (case-scoped)

AUTONOMY: LOW

GOAL
Enhance Evidence uploads (already working) by adding metadata fields + UI, and enforce HARD DELETE:
- Evidence is always scoped to ONE case (no cross-case reuse).
- Hard delete must remove the object from R2 AND remove the DB record (no recovery).

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT change marketing pages or public nav
- Do NOT redesign the app shell
- Keep existing routes exactly
- Minimum necessary edits only
- Continue using wouter <Link> and existing design tokens
- Do NOT add notifications yet (Twilio/SendGrid later)

REQUIREMENTS

A) DATABASE (shared/schema.ts + initDbTables)
1) Extend evidence_files table with these nullable columns:
- category (text)
- description (text)
- tags (text)  // store as comma-separated for now (no separate table yet)

2) Ensure initDbTables creates/updates evidence_files table definition accordingly.
If migrations aren’t in use, add a safe “add column if not exists” approach OR create table with the new columns if missing (same pattern used for other table init).

B) API
1) Evidence list endpoint must return the new metadata fields.
2) Add PATCH endpoint:
PATCH /api/cases/:caseId/evidence/:fileId
Body accepts: category, description, tags
Validate:
- category: max 50 chars, optional
- description: max 5000 chars, optional
- tags: max 500 chars, optional
Return structured validation errors like the timeline endpoints.

3) HARD DELETE enforcement:
DELETE /api/cases/:caseId/evidence/:fileId must:
- verify auth + case ownership + file ownership
- delete from R2 first
- only if R2 delete succeeds: delete DB record
- if R2 delete fails: return 500 with safe error message; do not delete DB record

C) FRONTEND (client/src/pages/AppEvidence.tsx)
1) Add metadata UI per file:
- Category dropdown (e.g., Document, Photo, Message, Medical, Financial, School, Other)
- Description textarea (optional)
- Tags input (optional)
2) Add “Save” button per file row/card to PATCH metadata.
3) Add filter controls:
- Filter by category (All + categories)
- Sort by newest/oldest
4) Hard delete UX:
- Keep existing confirm dialog
- After delete, refresh list; show success or error toast/message

D) VALIDATION (must pass)
- Upload still works
- List shows metadata
- Patch updates persist after refresh
- Delete removes file from R2 + DB (verify by refresh and download failing)
- Ownership enforced (cannot edit/delete other case’s files)
- No console errors

DELIVERABLE
- List files changed with line ranges
- Confirm endpoints added
- Confirm hard delete ordering (R2 first, DB second)
- Provide test steps I can run in the browser
