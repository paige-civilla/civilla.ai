REPLIT TASK: Firebase Usage Audit (determine if app uses Firebase keys, SDK, or endpoints)

Goal:
Tell Paige definitively:
1) Is Firebase used anywhere at runtime?
2) Are any Firebase keys/secrets present?
3) If Firebase is used, what features rely on it and what needs rerouting?

Do ALL checks and report results with file paths + line numbers.

A) Package / dependency check
- Inspect package.json for any of:
  firebase
  firebase-admin
  @firebase/*
  reactfire
  firebase-functions
  firebase-tools
Report:
- which packages exist
- whether they are used/imported

B) Code import + config search (whole repo)
Search for these strings across client + server:
- "firebase"
- "firebase-admin"
- "initializeApp"
- "getAuth"
- "getFirestore"
- "getStorage"
- "functions"
- "firestore"
- "google-services.json"
- "GoogleService-Info.plist"
- "FIREBASE"
- "VITE_FIREBASE"
- "NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE"
Report:
- every match with file + line number
- whether it’s dead code or active code path

C) Env / secrets check
Search for any Firebase-related env usage:
- process.env.FIREBASE*
- process.env.VITE_FIREBASE*
- process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE*
- process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS (sometimes used with firebase-admin)
Also check any config files:
- .env*, replit secrets references, config modules
Report:
- which env vars exist and where referenced

D) Network endpoints check
Search for any calls to Firebase/Google endpoints:
- "firestore.googleapis.com"
- "identitytoolkit.googleapis.com" (Firebase Auth REST)
- "googleapis.com"
- "firebaseapp.com"
- "web.app"
Report:
- any usage and where it happens

E) Runtime confirmation (quick smoke test)
If Firebase libs exist, add a safe startup log (dev only) that prints:
- "Firebase used: true/false"
based on whether any firebase initialization function runs.
DO NOT print any key values.

F) Conclusion (plain-English)
Return a clear conclusion in this exact format:

Firebase runtime usage: YES/NO
Firebase keys present in repo/secrets: YES/NO
If YES, what depends on it:
- Auth:
- Database:
- Storage:
- Analytics:
What must be rerouted if we unlink Firebase:
- (list items)

Important:
If Firebase is NOT used, recommend removing firebase packages and deleting firebase env vars to prevent confusion.
