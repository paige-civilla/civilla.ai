TASK: Fix navbar dropdowns not visible on hover/click (z-index + overflow clipping)

AUTONOMY: LOW

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change visual design, spacing, or copy.
- Only fix dropdown visibility and interaction behavior.
- Keep current hover/click behavior (but make the menu actually appear).

DIAGNOSIS (CONFIRMED):
- Dropdown is inside a stacking context with lower z-index than .civilla-nav-shell (z-index: 1000).
- Global CSS rule `[class*="container"] { overflow: hidden; }` can clip dropdowns (navbar wrappers often include max-w-container).
- Result: dropdown content renders but is hidden/clipped.

GOAL:
- Dropdown menus must be visible above everything, not clipped, on desktop + mobile.
- Hover OR click should open (whichever is already implemented) and the user must be able to interact with the menu.

FIX STRATEGY (DO THIS IN ORDER):

1) REMOVE/RESTRICT THE GLOBAL CLIPPING RULE
File: client/src/index.css
Find the rule that looks like:
  [class*="container"] { overflow: hidden; ... }
This rule is too broad and breaks dropdowns/modals/tooltips.

Replace it with a safer rule that DOES NOT apply to navbar/container wrappers.
Options (pick ONE):
A) Remove overflow:hidden entirely from that selector, keep other safe properties.
B) Narrow it to a specific wrapper class you control, e.g.:
   .civilla-page-shell [class*="container"] { overflow: hidden; }
But do NOT apply it to nav shells or global containers.

Required outcome:
- Navbar ancestors must allow overflow to be visible.

2) ENSURE NAV SHELL DOES NOT CLIP
In these files (whichever is used for the dropdown):
- client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
- client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx
- client/src/components/layout/AppNavbar.tsx
Make sure the immediate navbar wrapper has:
- overflow-visible
and does NOT sit inside an overflow-hidden ancestor.

3) RENDER DROPDOWNS IN A PORTAL LAYER (PREFERRED FIX)
Implement dropdown menus using a portal to document.body so they are immune to overflow clipping and stacking contexts.

Implementation requirements:
- When a menu is open, render the dropdown panel via ReactDOM.createPortal(...) to document.body.
- Use position: fixed for the dropdown panel.
- Compute its top/left from the trigger button’s getBoundingClientRect().
- Use z-index: 9999 (Tailwind: z-[9999]) so it sits above nav shell and all content.
- Add an outside-click handler to close (if not already present).
- Keep keyboard accessibility (Escape closes, focusable links inside).

4) VALIDATE
- Hover/click shows dropdown visibly on:
  - Home navbar
  - Cream navbar
  - App navbar
- Dropdown is not clipped at any viewport width.
- No console errors/warnings.

DELIVERABLE
- Report exact file changes (file + line ranges).
- Confirm global container clipping rule was removed or safely scoped.
- Confirm dropdowns are rendered via portal with z-[9999].
