TASK: Add Case-level Children Gating + Rename Workspace Title

CONSTRAINTS:
- Paige is not a developer. Make changes fully and ensure build passes.
- Do NOT remove the existing Children CRUD; only gate its visibility per-case.
- Children should NOT be in “onboarding” globally yet; instead we gate it in Case Profile (Case Settings page) and in the Case Workspace tiles.

GOALS:
A) Rename workspace header text:
- In the Case Workspace page (AppCase.tsx or whichever file renders the “Your Case Workspace” title), change it to exactly: "Case Workspace"

B) Add a case-level boolean flag: hasChildren
1) shared/schema.ts
- Add a new column to cases table:
  hasChildren: boolean("has_children").notNull().default(false)
- Update insertCaseSchema to accept hasChildren (optional), with default false.
- Export type updates accordingly.

2) server/db.ts
- Ensure initDbTables() handles existing databases:
  addColumnIfNotExists("cases", "has_children", "BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false")

3) server/routes.ts
- Ensure POST /api/cases accepts hasChildren and saves it.
- Ensure PATCH /api/cases/:caseId (or whichever update-case endpoint exists) allows updating hasChildren.
  - Validate hasChildren as boolean.
  - Ownership enforced.

4) client: Case Create flow
- Wherever a case is created (AppCases.tsx create modal or similar), add a simple Yes/No control:
  Label: "Does this case involve children?"
  Default: No
  Save to hasChildren.

5) client: Case Profile (Case Settings page)
- On the Case Profile/Case Settings page (AppCase.tsx if that’s the profile page), show a toggle/selector:
  Label: "This case involves children"
  Bound to hasChildren
  When user changes it, persist via PATCH /api/cases/:caseId

C) Gate the Children UI and Children module tile
1) Case Profile page:
- Only render the entire Children section (list/add/edit/delete UI) when hasChildren === true.
- If hasChildren === false, show a small neutral helper line instead:
  "Turn on 'This case involves children' to add child information."

2) Case Workspace tiles:
- Add a Children tile ONLY if hasChildren === true.
- Route: /app/case-settings/:caseId (or the correct case profile route you are using) and scroll to Children section if possible.
  If scroll-to is too much, just route to Case Profile page.

3) AppNavbar dropdown:
- If there is a Children item in the dropdown, also gate it based on currentCase.hasChildren.
- If not present, do nothing.

FINAL ACCEPTANCE TESTS:
- Create a new case → asked “Does this case involve children?” → if No: no Children tile, no Children section.
- Toggle “This case involves children” ON in Case Profile → Children tile appears and Children section appears with CRUD.
- Toggle OFF → Children tile disappears, Children section hides (does not delete data).
- Workspace header reads exactly “Case Workspace”.
- No TS errors, no console errors, build passes.
