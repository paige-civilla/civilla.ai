TASK: Fix production register/login 500 caused by SMTP host 'helium' DNS failure by making email sending non-fatal.

AUTONOMY: LOW
CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change routes, UI layout, colors, or copy.
- Do NOT remove auth features.
- Only adjust server-side mail behavior + error handling so register/login cannot 500 due to email issues.

OBSERVED ERROR (DEPLOY LOGS):
getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN helium
hostname: 'helium'
Registration/login returning 500.

GOALS:
1) Register and login must succeed even if email sending fails.
2) Magic link requests should not crash the server; if email fails, return a safe error message (or still return success but log).
3) Mail sending must be "fail-soft" in production: log error, never throw up to route handler.

IMPLEMENTATION:

A) server/mail.ts (or wherever mail is implemented)
- Ensure the mail sender NEVER throws uncaught exceptions.
- Wrap transport creation and sendMail in try/catch.
- If SMTP_* is missing OR transport fails, fall back to DEV mode: log the link/message to console and return.
- If SMTP_* exists but sending fails (DNS, auth, timeout), console.error a sanitized message and return a failure result instead of throwing.

B) server/routes.ts (or server/auth.ts depending on where routes live)
- In POST /api/auth/register:
  - Do NOT treat email sending as required.
  - Create user first; establish session; respond success.
  - If any optional email notification is attempted, wrap it so failure cannot cause 500.

- In POST /api/auth/login:
  - Same: email is not involved for password login, so ensure no mail call runs here.
  - If there is any mail call (unexpected), remove it or make it fail-soft.

- In magic link route:
  - If mail fails, return a clear 500 with { error: "Unable to send email right now" } OR return 200 with a generic message but log the failure (choose the least disruptive behavior).
  - Never crash the process.

C) Add a tiny debug log when SMTP is configured:
- On boot, log: "SMTP configured: yes/no" (do not print host value or credentials).

DELIVERABLE:
- List files changed + line ranges.
- Confirm:
  - /api/auth/register no longer 500s when SMTP fails
  - /api/auth/login no longer 500s
  - Magic link route fails gracefully without terminating server
