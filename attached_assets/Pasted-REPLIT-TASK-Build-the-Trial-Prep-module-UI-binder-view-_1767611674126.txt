REPLIT TASK: Build the Trial Prep module UI (binder view) with “Top 3” per section + export (ZIP). Also wire “Back/Continue” navigation.

Context:
- Backend already exists for trial_prep_shortlist with full CRUD:
  GET /api/cases/:caseId/trial-prep-shortlist
  POST /api/cases/:caseId/trial-prep-shortlist
  PATCH /api/trial-prep-shortlist/:itemId
  DELETE /api/trial-prep-shortlist/:itemId
- Items include: sourceType, sourceId, title, summary, binderSection, importance, tags (jsonb), color, isPinned
- Evidence module already has “Add to Trial Prep” buttons on notes/AI analyses/snippets/themes

Goal:
Create an actual Trial Prep module page that lets the user build a printable “trial binder” structure. It must show the “Top 3 best examples” per binder section (based on importance + pinned), and allow export.

A) ROUTES + MODULE NAV
1) Create page: client/src/pages/AppTrialPrep.tsx
2) Add routes (consistent with others):
   - /app/trial-prep/:caseId -> AppTrialPrep
   - /app/trial-prep -> <CaseRedirect targetPath="trial-prep" />
3) Ensure module tile and navbar menu include Trial Prep (if not already).
4) Ensure dashboard module order + navbar order match the current caseFlow ordering.

B) UI REQUIREMENTS (BINDER VIEW)
Layout:
- Page header:
  Title: “Trial Prep”
  Subtitle: “Build your binder: your strongest examples, organized by section.”
- Use existing theme tokens:
  background uses app background
  cards use module tile tokens
  borders use module tile border tokens

Main layout:
Left column: “Binder Sections” list (clickable)
Right column: Section details + Top 3 + full list

Binder Sections:
Use the binderSection enum values from schema (binderSectionValues). Render as human labels.
Example sections (use your actual enum list): Overview, Key Facts, Timeline Highlights, Communication Examples, Evidence Highlights, Requests, Witnesses, Exhibits, Orders/Filings, Other.
If enum differs, use existing binderSectionValues.

Per section display (right side):
1) “Top 3 for this section” card:
   - Automatically select the top 3 items:
     - Pinned first
     - Then highest importance
     - Then newest
   - Show each item in a compact “front page” style:
     Title
     1–2 sentence summary (or fallback to title if missing)
     Source badge (sourceType)
     Tags
     Color dot if color exists
     Buttons:
       - “Edit”
       - “Unpin/Pin”
       - “Remove”
2) “All items in this section” list:
   - Same item cards but fuller (include summary, tags, sourceType)
   - Drag/drop reorder is optional; if not implemented, include “Move up/down” buttons and persist by updating importance or add a sortOrder field only if absolutely necessary (prefer no schema change now).
3) “Add item manually” button:
   - Opens a modal to create a shortlist item that is not tied to a source:
     sourceType = "manual"
     sourceId = null/empty
     Required: title
     Optional: summary, tags, color, importance, pinned, binderSection (preselected)
   - This must POST to /api/cases/:caseId/trial-prep-shortlist

Editing:
- Edit modal for any item:
  title, summary, binderSection, importance (1-5), tags (comma separated), color picker (use simple input type="color" OR reuse your existing color palette), pin toggle.
- Persist via PATCH /api/trial-prep-shortlist/:itemId

C) EXPORT
Add an “Export Binder (ZIP)” button at top right.
Implement a backend endpoint:
- GET /api/cases/:caseId/trial-prep/export (auth required)
Returns a ZIP with:
- 00_README.txt (short explanation: educational/organizational, verify originals)
- One folder per binderSection (ordered)
  Each folder contains:
   - 00_TOP3.txt (formatted: Title + Summary + SourceType + Tags)
   - 01_ALL_ITEMS.txt (same format for all items)
- If an item sourceType points to evidence/snippet/etc, do NOT attempt to embed the original files yet unless it’s already trivial. For now, include a “Source reference” line:
  sourceType + sourceId
We can enhance export to include files after we validate the format.

D) “BACK TO DASHBOARD” + “CONTINUE TO NEXT MODULE”
On this Trial Prep page:
- Remove the left “Back to Dashboard” placement pattern.
- Place navigation buttons on the right side under the primary action area:
  - Secondary: “Back to Dashboard”
  - Primary: “Continue to <Next Module>”
Use the existing caseFlow helper to compute next module after trial-prep (skip gated ones).
If trial-prep is last, “Continue” should be disabled and say “You’re at the end”.

E) DETAILED REPORT
After implementing, respond with:
- Files changed
- New endpoint(s)
- Exact logic used to compute Top 3
- Screenshot notes: where Top 3 appears and how export is accessed
- Confirm no UPL language (no “you should file”, no outcome predictions)

IMPORTANT:
- Trial Prep is organizational only. Copy must be neutral:
  “Examples to consider,” “Strongest examples you selected,” “Verify against originals,” etc.
- Must work on mobile (320px): stack columns, sections become a dropdown, buttons become full-width, touch targets 44px.
