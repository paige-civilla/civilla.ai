REPLIT AGENT TASK: Global No-Hyphen Word Splits + Fix Text Overflow/Escaping Boxes Across ALL Pages (DO NOT TOUCH NAVBARS)

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- DO NOT edit these files at all:
  - client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
  - client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx
- Goal is global: prevent mid-word breaks (orga-nized) and keep text contained inside its boxes across ALL current + future pages/components.

WHAT’S HAPPENING
- The “no hyphen / no mid-word split” behavior is currently only applying on some pages, which means:
  1) Home likely has a CSS override or component-level class re-enabling hyphenation/word-break, OR
  2) Some pages use different typography wrappers/components that aren’t covered by the global rules.

PHASE 1 — VERIFY GLOBAL RULES ARE ACTUALLY GLOBAL
1) Open: client/src/index.css
2) Ensure these global rules exist (or replace with these exact rules at the BOTTOM of the file so they win):

html, body {
  -webkit-hyphens: none;
  hyphens: none;
  word-break: normal;
  overflow-wrap: normal;
}

/* Safety net for common text elements */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6,
p, li, span, a, button, label, small, strong, em,
blockquote, dd, dt, figcaption {
  -webkit-hyphens: none;
  hyphens: none;
  word-break: normal;
  overflow-wrap: normal;
}

/* Optional: if you use Tailwind Typography (.prose) anywhere */
.prose, .prose * {
  -webkit-hyphens: none;
  hyphens: none;
  word-break: normal;
  overflow-wrap: normal;
}

3) IMPORTANT: Do NOT add letter-spacing, margins, or font changes here. Only word-breaking/hyphenation controls.

PHASE 2 — FIND WHY HOME IS STILL BREAKING WORDS
4) Run these searches and identify any Home-only overrides:
rg -n "hyphens|hyphen|word-break|break-words|overflow-wrap|text-wrap|whitespace|prose" client/src/pages/Home.tsx client/src/components

5) If you find any of these classes/styles on Home or its hero/sections, REMOVE them (Home only) so the global rule governs:
- hyphens-auto
- break-words
- break-all
- [word-break:...]
- [hyphens:...]
- whitespace-pre-wrap (can behave oddly with wrapping)
Do not change layout or colors; only remove word-break/hyphenation overrides.

PHASE 3 — FIX “TEXT ESCAPES THE BOX” ACROSS ALL PAGES (RESPONSIVE)
This is usually caused by flex/grid children not allowing shrink, or by long unbreakable strings.
We want: normal wrapping (no mid-word splits), but also no overflow out of cards.

6) Add a small global utility class in index.css (safe, does NOT affect navbars):
.safe-text-container {
  min-width: 0;       /* critical for flex children to allow wrapping */
  overflow: hidden;   /* prevents text visually escaping rounded cards */
}

7) Apply .safe-text-container to card/box wrappers across pages/components where text can overflow.
Search likely offenders (cards/sections):
rg -n "rounded-|border|card|p-6|p-8|max-w|grid|flex" client/src/components client/src/pages

When a card is inside a flex or grid, ensure:
- The text container (the element wrapping the paragraph/headline) has: min-w-0
- If it’s Tailwind, prefer adding: min-w-0 overflow-hidden
Example pattern to apply inside cards:
className="min-w-0 overflow-hidden"

8) For edge cases like long URLs/emails (which can overflow without breaking mid-word):
- ONLY on those specific elements, allow safe breaking without hyphenating normal words:
  Add Tailwind class: break-all OR break-words
  BUT do NOT apply globally; only to known unbreakable strings (URLs, long IDs).

PHASE 4 — SMOKE TEST (DO THIS ON MULTIPLE PAGES)
9) Test on mobile preview:
- Home (hero + steps + FAQ + footer)
- How Civilla Works
- Plans & Pricing (since we’re starting it next)
- Legal & Compliance
- Safety & Support
Confirm:
- No mid-word splits anywhere (no orga-nized)
- Text wraps normally to the next line instead of breaking inside a word
- No text overflows out of rounded boxes/cards
- Navbars are unchanged

DELIVERABLE / REPORT BACK
- Confirm Navbar.tsx and NavbarCream.tsx were NOT modified
- Report file:line ranges for:
  - index.css global rules
  - any Home overrides removed
  - any components updated with min-w-0 / overflow-hidden / safe-text-container
- Confirm the issue is fixed on Home AND at least 3 other pages
