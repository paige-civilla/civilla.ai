TASK: Documents UX wording + step clarity polish (A + B)

AUTONOMY: LOW
SCOPE: UI TEXT ONLY (no backend changes, no styling redesign)
FILES: client/src/pages/AppDocuments.tsx only

GOAL:
Make the 3-step flow feel calm and outcome-based (not bossy), especially Step 3.
Step titles should describe what the user has, not command them.

WHAT TO CHANGE (exact copy):

1) Step titles (Tabs triggers or headings)
- Step 1 label -> "Step 1: Draft Your Document"
- Step 2 label -> "Step 2: Review & Edit"
- Step 3 label -> "Step 3: Court-Ready Document"
  (Replace any existing “Court formatted/Download”, “Court formatted”, “Download”, or “Court Filing” step title text.)

2) Helper text per step (short + reassuring)
Step 1 helper (near Draft list / create doc area):
"Start with a working draft. You’ll review everything before creating a court-formatted version."

Step 2 helper (near the Prepare/Review action area):
"Review your information and make any changes before generating a court-formatted document."

Step 3 helper (near history / downloads):
"These documents are formatted for court. You can download them as needed."
Add one extra line beneath it (small helper text, same style family as other helper text):
"Civilla does not file documents with the court."

3) Button labels (actions are fine as verbs)
- The button that opens the court-formatted flow should be:
"Prepare Court-Formatted DOCX"
(Replace any: “Prepare Court Filing (DOCX)”, “Download DOCX (Court Format)”, “Court formatted/Download”, etc.)

- In the Review modal final action button should be:
"Download Court-Formatted DOCX"
(If it currently says “Step 3: Download Court-Formatted DOCX”, remove “Step 3:” from the button; steps are in the UI, not in the button.)

- In history cards/buttons:
Replace "Re-download Court-Formatted DOCX" with:
"Download Court-Formatted DOCX"
(Users don’t care if it’s “re-”. If you want to keep that meaning, use a smaller subtext like “Generated on {date}”.)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (how to apply safely):
- Only update strings / labels / helper text. Do not change layout structure beyond adding the two helper lines in Step 3.
- Keep existing components (Tabs, Cards, Dialog) intact.
- Do not change CSS classes except if needed to match existing helper text styling.
- Make sure the wording appears consistently:
  - Tabs triggers (top step bar)
  - Step headers in each tab content
  - Primary action buttons

ACCEPTANCE TEST:
- Open Documents page:
  - Tabs show: “Step 1: Draft Your Document”, “Step 2: Review & Edit”, “Step 3: Court-Ready Document”
- Step 2 primary button reads: “Prepare Court-Formatted DOCX”
- Review modal final button reads: “Download Court-Formatted DOCX”
- Step 3 includes:
  - “These documents are formatted for court. You can download them as needed.”
  - “Civilla does not file documents with the court.”
- No TS errors, build passes.
