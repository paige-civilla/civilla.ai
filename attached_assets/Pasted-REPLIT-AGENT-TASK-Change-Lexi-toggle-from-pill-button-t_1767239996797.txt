REPLIT AGENT TASK: Change Lexi toggle from pill button to vertical edge bar (text vertical)

GOAL
- The Lexi toggle should NOT look like a button.
- It should be a green vertical bar that hugs the right edge.
- Text should read “Lexi” vertically (rotate head to read).
- Keep existing open/close behavior (toggle the right-side Lexi panel).
- Do NOT change Lexi panel layout or chat logic. This is UI-only.

WHAT TO DO
1) Find the Lexi toggle trigger element (the thing that currently renders like “Lexi ←” as a pill).
   Search terms to locate it:
   - "Lexi" and "toggle"
   - "Lexi ←"
   - "setLexiOpen"
   - "isLexiOpen"
   - "lexi-toggle"
   - "LexiPanel"
   Files are likely in one of:
   - client/src/components/*
   - client/src/layouts/*
   - client/src/AppLayout.tsx
   - client/src/components/Lexi*.tsx

2) Replace the CURRENT toggle JSX with the following JSX exactly.
   IMPORTANT:
   - Keep the SAME onClick handler you already have (toggle open/close).
   - Keep the SAME state variable you already have (isLexiOpen or open).
   - This replaces ONLY the trigger.

REPLACEMENT JSX (use Tailwind; no custom CSS file needed)

--- START REPLACEMENT ---

<div
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0}
  aria-label={isLexiOpen ? "Hide Lexi" : "Show Lexi"}
  data-testid="lexi-toggle"
  onClick={() => setIsLexiOpen((v) => !v)}
  onKeyDown={(e) => {
    if (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === " ") setIsLexiOpen((v) => !v);
  }}
  className={[
    // position: hug the right edge, vertically centered
    "fixed right-0 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 z-50",

    // bar shape: NOT a pill button; it’s a side grab bar
    "h-36 w-10 bg-bush text-white shadow-lg",
    "rounded-l-xl", // only rounded on left side

    // layout
    "flex items-center justify-center",
    "cursor-pointer select-none",

    // subtle hover/focus
    "hover:brightness-110 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-bush/40",
  ].join(" ")}
>
  <span
    className={[
      "font-heading font-semibold tracking-wide",
      "text-sm",

      // vertical text
      "[writing-mode:vertical-rl]",
      "[text-orientation:mixed]",
      "rotate-180", // makes it read top-to-bottom as Lexi
      "leading-none",
    ].join(" ")}
  >
    Lexi
  </span>
</div>

--- END REPLACEMENT ---

3) If your state setter is not named setIsLexiOpen, DO NOT rename the state.
   Instead, replace setIsLexiOpen with whatever your setter is (example: setOpenLexi).
   Likewise, replace isLexiOpen with whatever your open state is (example: lexiOpen).

4) Remove any extra arrow text/icon from the trigger (the bar should only say “Lexi” vertically).
   The open/close affordance is the slide-in panel itself.

5) Verify:
   - Bar is flush to the right edge and vertically centered.
   - Clicking toggles Lexi panel open/closed.
   - Tab focus works; Enter/Space toggles.
   - Bar does not overlap the Lexi panel when open (it can remain visible or you may hide it when open):
     Optional improvement:
       Add: {isLexiOpen ? "hidden" : ""} to the class list if you want it hidden while open.
