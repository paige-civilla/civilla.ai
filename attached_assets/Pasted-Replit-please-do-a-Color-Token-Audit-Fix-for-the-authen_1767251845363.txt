Replit — please do a “Color Token Audit + Fix” for the authenticated app UI.

GOAL (based on Paige’s screenshot):
- Inside the logged-in app, any remaining DARK GREEN “primary” buttons (and similar primary UI accents) should use the APP PRIMARY DARK BLUE instead.
- We also need you to report back with a clear list of color tokens + where colors are hardcoded, separated by:
  1) Marketing (pre-login) pages
  2) App (post-login) pages

APP COLOR TOKENS (use these as the source of truth inside the app scope):
- App background: #FAF8F4
- App navbar/footer/panels: #E4ECED
- App module tiles: #A2BEC2
- App module borders/text: #243032
- App input fill: #CFD7D5
- App primary button (use a DARK BLUE tone, not green). If you already created a variable for it, use that. If not, create one (see below).

STEP 1 — Add/confirm “scoped tokens” in client/src/index.css
- Ensure there is a clear “APP scope” selector (whatever you’re using for the authenticated layout, e.g. [data-scope="app"]).
- Under that app scope, define CSS variables for:
  --app-primary
  --app-primary-hover
  --app-primary-foreground
  --app-surface
  --app-panel
  --app-input
  --app-border
  --app-text

If you already have tokens like --bush, etc., DO NOT delete them. Just ensure the authenticated app uses the app tokens for primary actions.

Pick a DARK BLUE that fits Paige’s palette (must be “dark dark blue”, not green) and set:
- --app-primary = (dark blue)
- --app-primary-hover = slightly darker
- --app-primary-foreground = #FAF8F4 or white, whichever passes contrast best

STEP 2 — Fix the “dark green buttons” inside the app
We need to eliminate any app primary button styling that still uses:
- bg-bush
- text-bush
- border-bush
- hover:bg-bush/...
- any hardcoded green hex in authenticated components

Do this safely:
A) Create/confirm a reusable “AppPrimaryButton” style OR update the existing shared Button variant:
- If the app uses shadcn Button variants, add/adjust a variant (e.g. variant="appPrimary") that uses the app tokens:
  background: var(--app-primary)
  hover background: var(--app-primary-hover)
  text: var(--app-primary-foreground)

B) Replace usages across authenticated pages:
- Search and replace in client/src/pages and client/src/components (authenticated only):
  rg -n "bg-bush|text-bush|border-bush|#0F3B2E|bush" client/src
- Update those primary-action buttons to use the new app primary button variant/class.

IMPORTANT:
- Marketing pages (pre-login) can keep the green vibe. Only change authenticated pages/components.

STEP 3 — Audit and report: “colors I still need to know about”
After changes, output a report in your response with TWO SECTIONS:

SECTION A: Marketing (pre-login)
- List every hardcoded hex color found under marketing routes/components
- List any token names used (CSS variables or Tailwind custom colors)
- Identify the “Primary”, “Primary Hover”, “Background”, “Surface”, “Border”, “Text”, “Input” colors currently used

SECTION B: App (post-login)
- Same list as above, but for authenticated app components/pages
- Specifically list any remaining green/bush usage (should be none for primary actions)

To generate the lists, run:
- rg -n "#[0-9A-Fa-f]{3,8}" client/src
- rg -n "bg-bush|text-bush|border-bush|bush" client/src
Then categorize hits by whether the file is used pre-login vs post-login.

STEP 4 — Confirm by touching at least these UI spots (app side):
- The Case Workspace banner and any CTA buttons
- The “View all cases” button
- The Documents “Prepare Court Filing (DOCX)” button
- Any “Save”, “Create”, “Next” buttons in onboarding/account settings

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the app primary dark blue token + apply it to all authenticated primary buttons.
- Return the color audit report (Marketing vs App) and name any additional colors you think Paige should specify next (e.g., destructive/burgundy, warning, success, muted text).

Do NOT change any locked components noted in replit.md (if applicable). Only adjust styling via tokens/variants/classes so it is consistent and maintainable.
