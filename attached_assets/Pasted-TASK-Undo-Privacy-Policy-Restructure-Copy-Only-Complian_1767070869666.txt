TASK: Undo Privacy Policy Restructure (Copy-Only Compliance) + Keep Required AI Sentence

AUTONOMY: LOW
SCOPE: COPY ONLY — NO DESIGN, NO LAYOUT, NO NEW SECTIONS

CONTEXT:
We had a constraint breach: Privacy Policy was restructured into headed sections even though we required COPY ONLY with no structure changes.

GOAL:
1) Terms of Service: keep the already-added “no court/government affiliation” paragraph exactly as-is.
2) Privacy Policy: revert to the pre-restructure format (paragraph style / original structure), then add ONE required sentence in the correct location.
3) Do NOT change styling, spacing, components, or page layout.

PRIVACY POLICY REQUIRED SENTENCE (ADD VERBATIM):
“We do not use your private content to train public or third-party artificial intelligence models without your explicit consent.”

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
A) Privacy page file:
- Open the Privacy Policy page component (likely: client/src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.tsx).
- Identify what “restructure” was done (new headings, new numbering, grouped sections).
- Revert that restructuring so the page returns to its prior paragraph-based structure.
  - If there is a Replit checkpoint immediately before the restructure, use it as reference and manually restore the copy to match it.
  - Do NOT introduce any new headings/section titles if they didn’t exist before.
  - Do NOT rewrite or “improve” copy beyond restoring it.

B) Insert the required AI sentence:
- Find the paragraph that explains user case materials/content are private and belong to them (the “Your Content and Confidentiality” concept).
- Append the required sentence directly after that paragraph.
- Do not add a new header to place it. Do not add any other disclaimers.

C) Verification:
- Confirm only Privacy Policy copy structure was reverted + the one sentence added.
- Confirm Terms page unchanged aside from the already-approved added paragraph.
- Confirm no console errors.

DELIVERABLE:
- Report the exact file edited and the exact paragraph location where the AI sentence was appended.
- Confirm no other text was modified beyond restoring pre-restructure copy + adding the one required sentence.
