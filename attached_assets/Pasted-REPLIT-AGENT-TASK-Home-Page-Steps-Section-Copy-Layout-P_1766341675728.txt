REPLIT AGENT TASK: Home Page “Steps” Section Copy + Layout Polish (No Buttons, Title Case, Spelled-Out Numbers, One Continuous Underline)

GOAL
Update the 3-column “Step One / Step Two / Step Three” section on the HOME page so it:
- Uses Title Case step labels with numbers spelled out: “Step One”, “Step Two”, “Step Three”
- Has ONE continuous horizontal line under the step labels (spanning all 3 columns)
- Removes the three buttons/links (“Begin”, “Organize”, “Understand”) entirely
- Replaces the placeholder copy with UPL-safe, educational/research/organizational wording (no legal advice, no representation, no outcome promises)

FILES
1) MUST EDIT: client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx
2) DO NOT EDIT (for this task): HowCivillaWorks.tsx (it has separate “Step one/two/three” content)

INSTRUCTIONS — EXACT CHANGES

A) EDIT: client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx

1) FIND the existing strings and update the step labels:
- Replace “Step one” with “Step One”
- Replace “Step two” with “Step Two”
- Replace “Step three” with “Step Three”

2) REMOVE ALL THREE BUTTONS/LINKS from this section:
- Delete the element(s) that render the “Begin” CTA
- Delete the element(s) that render the “Organize” CTA
- Delete the element(s) that render the “Understand” CTA
(These may be <button>, <a>, or <Link>. Remove the whole clickable elements, not just the text.)

3) REPLACE THE THREE PARAGRAPHS with the following final copy (exact text):

STEP ONE PARAGRAPH (replace the current paragraph under Step One):
“Choose your state and case type. Civilla surfaces educational information and typical court steps for that jurisdiction and case category.”

STEP TWO PARAGRAPH (replace the current paragraph under Step Two):
“Add your documents, messages, and key events. Civilla organizes what you provide into a clear timeline so you can review everything in context.”

STEP THREE PARAGRAPH (replace the current paragraph under Step Three):
“Get plain-language explanations of common stages and what information people typically prepare — without legal advice or outcome promises.”

4) IMPLEMENT ONE CONTINUOUS UNDERLINE UNDER THE STEP LABELS
Restructure ONLY the inner layout of the 3 columns so the step labels appear in a single row, then a full-width line, then the three paragraphs in the next row.

Use this layout pattern (adapt classNames to match the existing styling, but keep the structure):

- Keep the existing outer <section> / container wrappers intact.
- Inside the section, render a grid like:

Row 1 (3 columns): Step One | Step Two | Step Three
Row 2 (full width): a single divider line spanning all columns
Row 3 (3 columns): Paragraph 1 | Paragraph 2 | Paragraph 3

Add a divider element like:
<div className="col-span-1 md:col-span-3 w-full border-b border-black/20" />
(If the section is on dark background, use border-white/20 instead.)

IMPORTANT: The divider should sit directly under the step labels, not under the paragraphs.

5) OPTIONAL (Recommended) — Add a Small Safety Net Line Under The 3 Paragraphs
If the design has room (or there’s already a small text slot), add this as a single small line beneath the three paragraphs (full width):
“Educational, Research, And Organizational Support — Not Legal Advice Or Representation.”
If adding this line disrupts spacing, skip it (do not force it).

VERIFY
- Home page: the section shows “Step One / Step Two / Step Three” (Title Case, spelled-out numbers)
- One continuous underline sits under the step labels across all 3 columns
- No “Begin / Organize / Understand” buttons or links exist in this section
- Copy matches exactly the paragraphs above
- No console errors

REPORT BACK
- Confirm file edited: client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx
- Provide the exact line ranges changed
- Confirm the three buttons were removed and the underline row is full width
