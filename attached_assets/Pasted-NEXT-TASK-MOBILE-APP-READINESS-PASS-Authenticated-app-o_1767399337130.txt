NEXT TASK — MOBILE APP READINESS PASS (Authenticated app + onboarding + dashboard)

Goal:
Make the entire app usable on iPhone/Android screen sizes with no cut off text, no horizontal scroll, correct spacing, and touch-friendly navigation.

Scope:
- This is a UI/UX + responsive pass only. Do not change backend logic.
- Focus primarily on post-login app pages (.app-shell), but also fix login/register/onboarding if needed.
- Must work for widths: 320px, 375px, 390px, 414px, 768px, and desktop.

Non-negotiable requirements:
1) No text truncation/cutoff on any page at 320px width.
2) No horizontal scrolling anywhere (unless inside a deliberate horizontal scroller).
3) Tap targets: minimum 44px height for buttons/interactive items.
4) Sticky/scroll behavior: Onboarding steps always start at top when switching steps. Closing policy modals returns user to the SAME scroll position of the onboarding step (not bottom of page).
5) Navbar/dropdown: usable on touch (tap to open/close), not hover-only on mobile. Must not disappear “testy.” Must close on outside tap.
6) Lexi panel: must not cover primary actions on mobile. If open, the app content behind should not be tappable; closing via outside tap works.
7) Calendar + Upcoming list: must stack cleanly on mobile. Calendar should be full width. “Upcoming” list below it.
8) Module tiles: must become 1 column on mobile, 2 on small tablets, 3+ on desktop. Tile text must wrap cleanly.
9) Forms: inputs/textareas must be full width on mobile, labels readable, error text not overflowing. Use proper spacing between fields.
10) Tables/lists (Evidence, Deadlines, Case To-Do, Documents, Exhibits, Pattern Analysis): cards must wrap, metadata lines must wrap, buttons must not overflow.

Implementation directions (do all of these):
A) Create a responsive layout system for app pages
- Add a shared container utility (or update AppLayout) so pages consistently use:
  - max width constraints on desktop
  - padding that adapts (px-4 mobile, px-6 tablet, px-8 desktop)
  - vertical spacing that adapts (gap-3/4 mobile, gap-6 desktop)
- Ensure all app pages inherit the same layout behavior.

B) Fix AppNavbar for mobile
- If viewport is < md:
  - Replace hover behavior with click/tap toggle
  - Add a hamburger menu OR a clearly tappable menu trigger
  - Ensure dropdown uses position: fixed with inset and scroll, so it never renders off-screen
  - Ensure logout is always visible/reachable
- Add “safe close” behavior:
  - close on outside tap
  - close on route change
  - close on ESC (desktop)
- Make icons/text responsive (no overlap when zoomed)

C) Dashboard mobile layout
- At < lg:
  - Calendar and Upcoming should stack
  - Modules grid becomes 1 column
  - View All Cases becomes a compact button that doesn’t stretch full width unless needed
- Remove any remaining headings we previously flagged (Modules / Case Workspace) if still present

D) Calendar component mobile polish
- Fix any header spacing/gaps at small sizes
- Month view should be full width with readable day cells
- Ensure dots/badges do not overflow cells
- “Add item” flow must be mobile friendly (modal fits screen, scroll inside modal if needed)

E) Onboarding mobile polish
- Each step must start at top. Force scrollTo(0) on step change and modal close.
- Ensure policy modal opens at top and is scrollable within the modal on mobile.
- The intro warning screen (Step 0) must be readable and not cramped.
- Review & Confirm step must display as stacked cards with “Edit” buttons full width on mobile.

F) Lexi panel mobile behavior
- On mobile:
  - open as a full-screen or near-full-screen sheet from the right or bottom
  - must have a clear close button
  - must not block nav or primary actions unexpectedly
  - outside tap closes (and returns to exactly where user was)

G) Mobile QA pass
Create a checklist and test these routes at 320px width:
- /login
- /register
- /app/onboarding
- /app (dashboard)
- /app/cases
- /app/case/:caseId (workspace)
- /app/case-settings/:caseId
- /app/documents/:caseId
- /app/timeline/:caseId
- /app/evidence/:caseId
- /app/exhibits/:caseId
- /app/tasks/:caseId (Case To-Do)
- /app/deadlines/:caseId
- /app/patterns/:caseId (Pattern Analysis)
- /app/account

For each page, confirm:
- no horizontal scroll
- no clipped text
- buttons are tappable
- modals fit screen and scroll correctly
- dropdown and Lexi behave correctly

Output requirements (very important):
1) Provide a detailed final summary:
   - Files edited (full paths)
   - What changed per file
   - Before/after behavior
2) Provide the QA checklist with PASS/FAIL for every route above.
3) If any item cannot be fixed quickly, implement a temporary safe fallback and document it.

Proceed now and complete the full mobile readiness pass.
