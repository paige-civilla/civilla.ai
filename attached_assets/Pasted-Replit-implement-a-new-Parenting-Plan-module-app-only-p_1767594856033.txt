Replit — implement a new Parenting Plan module (app-only, post-login).

GOAL
Add a comprehensive, court-ready Parenting Plan module that:
• Is educational and organizational (NOT legal advice)
• Is fully structured, all-encompassing, and age-aware
• Can later generate a Parenting Plan document
• Fits correctly in the case workflow

MODULE PLACEMENT
• Dashboard order: AFTER “Exhibits” and AFTER “Document Creator”
• Navigation menu must match dashboard order
• Route pattern: /app/parenting-plan/:caseId

DATA MODEL (REQUIRED)
Add these tables in shared/schema.ts:

1) parenting_plans
- id (uuid, pk)
- userId
- caseId
- status ("draft" | "reviewed")
- lastUpdatedAt
- createdAt

2) parenting_plan_sections
- id (uuid, pk)
- parentingPlanId
- sectionKey (string, e.g. "medical", "education")
- data (jsonb) ← flexible structured content
- createdAt
- updatedAt

Do NOT hardcode answers — store structured user input only.

BACKEND
• Add full CRUD endpoints:
  GET /api/cases/:caseId/parenting-plan
  POST /api/cases/:caseId/parenting-plan
  PATCH /api/parenting-plan/:id
• Enforce userId + caseId ownership
• No legal logic, no recommendations

FRONTEND
Create:
client/src/pages/AppParentingPlan.tsx

Page structure:
• ModuleIntro at top:
  Title: “Parenting Plan”
  Description:
  “A parenting plan organizes parenting responsibilities, schedules, and decision-making areas. Civilla helps you organize information — it does not provide legal advice or recommendations.”

• Accordion-based sections for:
  - Decision-Making
  - Parenting Time
  - Holidays
  - Medical
  - Education
  - Communication
  - Extracurriculars
  - Travel
  - Childcare
  - Safety
  - Financial Responsibilities
  - Modification

Each section:
• Uses neutral prompts (“Describe how decisions are handled”)
• Supports text fields, toggles, schedules
• Saves automatically (draft mode)

LEXI INTEGRATION
• Add LexiSuggestedQuestions under ModuleIntro
• Example prompts:
  - “What does my state require in a parenting plan?”
  - “What topics are usually included in parenting plans?”
  - “How do courts typically structure holiday schedules?”

Lexi must respond in EDUCATIONAL + RESEARCH mode only.

DOCUMENT INTEGRATION (later use)
• Parenting Plan data must be structured so it can be used by:
  - Document Creator
  - Exhibits
• Do NOT generate filings automatically

UI / THEME
• Module tile:
  bg: var(--module-tile)
  border: var(--module-tile-border)
  icon: Users (lucide-react)
• Matches existing module styles

ACCEPTANCE CHECK
✔ Parenting Plan appears after Exhibits
✔ Sections are comprehensive and editable
✔ No legal advice language anywhere
✔ Lexi research prompts appear
✔ Data persists per case
✔ Ready for future DOCX export
