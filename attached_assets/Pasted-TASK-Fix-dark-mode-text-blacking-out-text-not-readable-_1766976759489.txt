TASK: Fix dark mode text “blacking out” (text not readable)

AUTONOMY: LOW
GOAL:
When dark mode is enabled, ALL text remains readable (no “black on dark” or “dark on dark”).
Do NOT redesign layout or change copy. Only adjust color classes to be theme-aware.

CONSTRAINTS:
- No spacing/layout refactors
- No copy changes
- Prefer token-based colors already in the project
- Avoid introducing new palettes (no bg-green-, text-green-, etc.)

ROOT CAUSE:
Many components use light-only text classes like:
- text-neutral-darkest
- text-black
- text-[#070503]
but in dark mode the background becomes dark, so the text becomes invisible.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
1) Define/confirm safe global text defaults at the page wrapper level
   Files:
   - client/src/components/layout/PublicLayout.tsx
   - client/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx

   Ensure wrapper uses:
   - Light: dark text on cream
   - Dark: light text on dark

   Example wrapper class (use existing tokens you already have):
   className="min-h-screen bg-cream text-neutral-darkest dark:bg-neutral-darkest dark:text-cream"

2) Sweep “hardcoded dark text” and add dark variants
   Search and patch ONLY color classes (no structure changes) for these patterns:

   Replace:
   - text-neutral-darkest → text-neutral-darkest dark:text-cream
   - text-black / text-[#070503] → text-neutral-darkest dark:text-cream
   - text-neutral-darkest/70 → text-neutral-darkest/70 dark:text-cream/70
   - text-neutral-darkest/50 → text-neutral-darkest/50 dark:text-cream/50

   Also for subtle labels:
   - text-neutral-darkest/60 → text-neutral-darkest/60 dark:text-cream/60

3) Cards/boxes need theme-aware surfaces
   Anywhere you see these backgrounds:
   - bg-white
   - bg-cream
   - bg-[#fcfbf9]
   Add a dark background so text has contrast:
   - bg-white → bg-white dark:bg-neutral-darkest/60
   - bg-cream → bg-cream dark:bg-neutral-darkest/60
   and ensure border switches if needed:
   - border-neutral-darkest/20 → border-neutral-darkest/20 dark:border-cream/20

4) Links + buttons readable in dark mode
   - Links that were dark should become light in dark mode:
     text-neutral-darkest → text-neutral-darkest dark:text-cream
   - Outlined buttons that are dark-outline in light mode should invert in dark mode:
     border-neutral-darkest/20 → border-neutral-darkest/20 dark:border-cream/30
     text-neutral-darkest → text-neutral-darkest dark:text-cream

5) Priority targets (where you’ll see the issue most):
   - client/src/components/Hero.tsx (headline, subtext, CTA)
   - client/src/components/Footer.tsx (all column headings + links)
   - client/src/pages/Home.tsx (section headings + body text)
   - client/src/pages/Plans.tsx (pricing cards text + footnotes)
   - Any “Hero box” / section-card component used sitewide

VALIDATION:
- Toggle dark mode: all headings + body text readable on every page
- Footer switches and remains readable
- No console errors

DELIVERABLE:
- List each file changed + line ranges
- Confirm which classes were updated (text + bg + border)
