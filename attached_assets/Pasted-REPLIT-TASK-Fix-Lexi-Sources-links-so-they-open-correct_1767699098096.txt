REPLIT TASK: Fix Lexi “Sources” links so they open correctly (no “false / unavailable / not found”)

Problem
All Lexi “source links” fail (false/unavailable/not found). Likely causes:
- Lexi outputs non-URL citations (titles, “Idaho Code § …”, etc.) instead of real https:// links
- UI is routing links through internal navigation (wouter) so external links become “not found”
- Markdown renderer isn’t creating anchors properly or links are being sanitized/blocked

Goal
- Lexi outputs SOURCES as real URLs
- UI renders them as external <a href="https://..."> links that open in a new tab
- No internal router interception
- If a source doesn’t have a reliable URL, Lexi must say so and provide the official site path to search

A) Enforce “real URLs only” in Lexi research output (server prompt)
File: server/routes.ts (Lexi chat handler)

In the system prompt (or research-mode instruction block), add:

"SOURCES REQUIREMENT:
- When you cite a source, include the full URL starting with https://
- Provide sources as a bullet list under a 'Sources' heading
- Prefer primary sources (state legislature, judiciary, official court rules/forms pages)
- If you cannot find an official URL, say 'No official URL found' and give the official site name + what to search for"

Also add:
"Never output placeholder links (example.com) or text like 'Idaho Courts (link)'. Always include the real https URL."

B) Make Markdown links open externally (client)
File: client/src/components/lexi/LexiPanel.tsx

If you implemented react-markdown already:
- Add a custom link renderer that forces:
  - target="_blank"
  - rel="noreferrer noopener"
  - allows only http/https

Example:

<ReactMarkdown
  remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}
  components={{
    a: ({ href, children, ...props }) => {
      const safe = typeof href === "string" && /^https?:\/\//i.test(href);
      if (!safe) {
        return <span className="underline decoration-dotted">{children}</span>;
      }
      return (
        <a
          href={href}
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          className="underline"
          {...props}
        >
          {children}
        </a>
      );
    },
  }}
>
  {content}
</ReactMarkdown>

Important:
- Do NOT use Link from wouter for Lexi content.
- Ensure nothing is calling setLocation(href) for Lexi links.

C) Stop internal navigation interception (if present)
Search for any “onClick” handler that intercepts anchor clicks inside the Lexi message container.

Repo search:
rg -n "preventDefault|setLocation\\(|navigate\\(" client/src/components/lexi

If found, change it so:
- Only intercepts internal app links that start with "/app"
- Everything else is left as a normal external link click

Rule:
if href startsWith("/app") -> internal navigation
else -> let browser open normally

D) Improve “Sources” UX (optional but recommended)
In Lexi UI, detect a “Sources” section and visually separate it:
- small header “Sources”
- each link shows domain + title snippet if available
But do not rewrite URLs.

E) Test Plan
1) Ask Lexi (Research mode): "What is the deadline to respond to a divorce petition in Idaho? Provide official sources with URLs."
2) Expected:
- Sources render as clickable links
- Clicking opens new tab to official Idaho Legislature / Idaho Courts pages
- No “not found” in-app page

Report back
- Files changed
- Confirm at least 3 real https:// links open successfully from Lexi
