Replit — Move the “Savings Widget” OFF the dashboard and into Account Settings as a tiny compact widget.

Goal:
- Dashboard: remove Savings Widget entirely.
- Account Settings: add a very small widget (about 260–320px wide) that can expand/collapse. Default collapsed so it’s not “big”.
- Keep the existing savings logic if possible; just relocate + restyle. Routes stay the same.

Steps:

1) REMOVE from Dashboard
File: client/src/pages/AppDashboard.tsx
- Search for the Savings widget component/section. Look for:
  “Savings”, “Estimated savings”, “TurboTax”, “calculator”, “lawyer”, or a component name like SavingsWidget.
- Delete that entire Savings widget JSX section AND any related state/hooks/mutations used only by it.
- Ensure the module grid and calendar layout still looks correct after removal.

2) ADD a compact widget to Account Settings
File: client/src/pages/AppAccountSettings.tsx  (or whatever the Account Settings page file is called in this repo)
- Add a small card section near the top (under profile basics) with:
  Title: “Savings Estimate”
  Subtitle: “Optional quick calculator”
  A small button to expand/collapse: “Show” / “Hide”
- When collapsed: show only title + one-line summary (e.g., “Estimate your potential legal cost savings.”)
- When expanded: show the existing savings calculator UI (inputs + output) BUT constrained to a max width:
  className="w-full max-w-[320px]"
  and make inputs compact (smaller text, tighter padding).

3) If the savings widget exists as a reusable component:
- Move it into: client/src/components/SavingsWidget.tsx (if not already)
- Export it and reuse it in Account Settings.
- In Account Settings pass a prop like `compact` to render smaller spacing.

4) Compact styling requirements (inside app theme):
- Container: bg-[#E4ECED] border border-[#628286] rounded-xl
- Text: text-[#243032]
- Button: bg-[#314143] text-[#FAF8F4]
- Keep it visually “tiny”: max-w-[320px], and do NOT span full page width on desktop.

5) Make sure nothing else breaks:
- Run TypeScript check / LSP and fix missing imports.
- Restart the app.
- Verify:
  a) Dashboard no longer shows savings widget
  b) Account Settings shows the small collapsed widget
  c) Clicking “Show” expands it and calculator works
  d) Mobile: widget is still full width (w-full) but remains compact vertically

After you finish, paste back:
- The removed dashboard snippet (what you deleted)
- The new Account Settings section snippet
- The component file name where the savings widget lives now
