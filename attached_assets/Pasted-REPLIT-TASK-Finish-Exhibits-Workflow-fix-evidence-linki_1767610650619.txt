REPLIT TASK: Finish Exhibits Workflow (fix evidence linking, ordering, and Export Packet ZIP)

Context
We added Exhibits settings (cover page fields + usedForFiling + filingDate). But the workflow is still missing:
- Exhibit lists must actually contain linked evidence + snippets in a real ordered “packet”
- Evidence “Add to Exhibit” must reliably create the link row
- User must be able to export the exhibit list as ONE download (ZIP v1)

GOALS (do ALL)

A) FIX “ADD EVIDENCE TO EXHIBIT” RELIABILITY
1) Verify Evidence → “Add to Exhibit” creates a real row linking evidence to exhibit list.
   - If your schema uses exhibit_evidence join table, ensure the mutation inserts there.
   - Ensure evidenceId belongs to caseId and userId.
2) In AppExhibits, the Exhibit List detail view must display:
   - Linked evidence files (filename, createdAt, download/open button)
   - Snippets (title, pageNumber, text preview)
   - Cover Page (from exhibit list fields OR a dedicated cover entry)

B) ADD ORDERING (PERSISTED)
We need a stable packet order: Cover Page → Evidence items → Snippets (or mixed if user reorders).

Implement simplest v1:
1) Add sortOrder columns:
   - exhibit_evidence.sortOrder (default incremental)
   - exhibit_snippets.sortOrder (default incremental)
   (If exhibit_evidence is missing or is not a table, create it or add sortOrder to the correct structure.)
2) In backend list endpoint(s), return ordered items using sortOrder ASC, createdAt ASC as fallback.
3) In frontend (AppExhibits list detail), add Up/Down buttons on each item:
   - “Move up” and “Move down”
   - Call PATCH endpoints to swap sortOrder with neighbor item
4) Cover page always stays at top (not reorderable in v1).

C) EXPORT PACKET (ZIP V1)
Add endpoint:
GET /api/cases/:caseId/exhibit-lists/:listId/export  (requireAuth)

Export output:
- A ZIP file containing:
  1) 00_Cover_Page.txt (generated from cover page title/subtitle/notes + usedForFiling fields)
  2) 01_Snippets.txt (all snippets in order, include page numbers if set)
  3) /Evidence/ folder with all linked evidence files in order (download each from storage and include original file names)
  4) Optional: manifest.json with ordered list + IDs (for debugging)

Implementation notes:
- Use archiver (node) or a similar library.
- Stream ZIP to response.
- Must validate: user owns caseId; exhibit list belongs to caseId; linked evidence belongs to caseId.

Frontend:
1) Add “Export Packet” button on each Exhibit List card (or inside the expanded view).
2) When clicked:
   - Show loading state
   - Download ZIP file: exhibit_packet_<caseNicknameOrId>_<listTitle>.zip

D) CONFIRM SNIPPETS SHOW IN EXHIBIT LIST
In AppExhibits, inside each exhibit list detail:
- Show snippets with title + page number + snippet text preview
- Add edit/delete controls (existing CRUD)
- Add “Add to Trial Prep” button for snippets (if not already)

E) REPORT BACK DETAILED SUMMARY
After implementing, respond with:
- Files changed
- New/updated endpoints
- How ordering works
- Exact ZIP contents
- Confirmation that Evidence → Add to Exhibit now results in evidence appearing inside the exhibit list view
