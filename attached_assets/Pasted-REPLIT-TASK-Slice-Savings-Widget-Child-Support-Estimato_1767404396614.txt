REPLIT TASK: Slice — Savings Widget + Child Support Estimator Module (Foundation)

GOALS
A) Dashboard: Add a TurboTax-style “Estimated Savings” widget ABOVE the “View All Cases” button.
B) Modules: Add a “Child Support Estimator” module tile and route/page inside the app.
C) Keep it EDUCATIONAL only (no court-accurate claim), clear disclaimer text, consistent app theme tokens.
D) Mobile-ready.

REQUIREMENTS / UX
1) Savings Widget (Dashboard)
- Location: AppDashboard.tsx, above the “View All Cases” button.
- Title: “Estimated Savings”
- Subtitle: “A quick estimate of time saved when you stay organized.”
- Inputs (simple, friendly):
  - “Hours you expect to spend organizing your case” (number input, default 10)
  - “Hourly value (editable)” (number input, default 300)
  - “Include document prep time” checkbox (default on, adds +25% to hours)
- Output:
  - Show a large computed number: hours * hourlyValue (and if checkbox on, hours*1.25)
  - Show helper text: “This is an educational estimate. Actual costs vary.”
- Button: “Update estimate” (optional; can auto-update on change if you prefer)
- Styling:
  - Use app theme: background = app background (#FAF8F4), card surface = white, border = #A2BEC2.
  - Primary button uses bg-primary/text-primary-foreground (dark blue).
  - Inputs use bg-input (#CFD7D5).
  - Ensure spacing looks good and does not create dead space.

2) Add “Upcoming” list (if not already in place)
- Under the month calendar, show a header “Upcoming” and list next 7 items.
- Each item has a checkbox and toggling it marks the item done everywhere it applies:
  - deadlines -> done
  - case to-do -> completed
  - calendar items -> completed
- If that cross-module toggle wiring already exists, keep it; if not, implement it now via one unified endpoint (see below).

3) Child Support Estimator Module
- Add a new module tile on dashboard + case workspace (where tiles are shown).
- Label: “Child Support Estimator”
- Route should be inside the app and case-scoped:
  - /app/child-support/:caseId
- Add to AppNavbar dropdown as well.
- Page: client/src/pages/AppChildSupport.tsx
  - Layout matches other app pages (AppLayout).
  - Simple estimator foundation:
    - Inputs (all optional, can use “I don’t know yet” buttons):
      - State (prefill from case if exists)
      - Number of children (prefill from case children count if available)
      - Overnights per year (or percentage parenting time)
      - Parent A monthly gross income
      - Parent B monthly gross income
      - Childcare/month, Health insurance/month (optional)
    - Output: show “Estimated range” placeholder and “Next steps” guidance.
    - VERY CLEAR disclaimer text:
      - “Not court-accurate. Courts and formulas vary by state and case. For a court-accurate amount, consult an attorney or use your state’s official calculator.”
  - Do NOT implement state-by-state legal formulas yet. This is foundation + UI only.

4) Unified “Mark complete” wiring (only if missing)
- Add a single backend endpoint to mark an upcoming item complete:
  POST /api/cases/:caseId/upcoming/:itemType/:itemId/complete
  where itemType in: "deadline" | "task" | "calendar"
- Update the correct table field:
  - deadlines: set status done/true (whatever field exists)
  - tasks: set completed true
  - calendar items: set completed true
- Return { ok: true } and updated record.

5) Files to update / create
- client/src/pages/AppDashboard.tsx (Savings widget placement + upcoming list consistency)
- client/src/pages/AppCase.tsx (add module tile if case workspace shows tiles)
- client/src/components/layout/AppNavbar.tsx (add menu link)
- client/src/App.tsx (add route)
- Create: client/src/pages/AppChildSupport.tsx
- server/routes.ts (only if unified complete endpoint is needed)
- shared/schema.ts + server/db.ts (only if calendar items lack “completed” field; otherwise do NOT alter schema)

6) Acceptance tests
- Dashboard shows Estimated Savings widget above View All Cases
- Widget computes correctly and looks clean on mobile
- Child Support Estimator tile navigates correctly
- Child Support page loads and is mobile-safe
- Upcoming list shows and checkbox completion updates the source module record (task/deadline/calendar)
- No console errors
- Publish ready
