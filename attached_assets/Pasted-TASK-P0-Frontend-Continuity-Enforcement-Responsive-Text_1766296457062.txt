TASK (P0): Frontend Continuity Enforcement + Responsive Text Containment

AUTONOMY: LOW

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT redesign.
- Do NOT change copy.
- Do NOT add new pages/features.
- Do NOT change routes.
- Only fix routing continuity + responsive containment.

GOALS
A) Enforce routing continuity across the entire frontend:
   1) Internal navigation must NEVER use href:"#"
   2) Internal navigation must NEVER use window.location.href or window.location.replace
   3) All internal links must use wouter <Link href="..."> (or the project’s router-native Link)
   4) External links remain <a>

B) Enforce “text stays inside boxes” continuity rule everywhere:
   1) No text should overflow its card/section at any viewport width
   2) Long words/URLs must wrap
   3) Flex/grid children must be allowed to shrink (min-w-0)
   4) Prevent horizontal scrolling caused by layout overflow

DELIVERABLES
1) ROUTING AUDIT + FIX
   - Search the entire client/src for:
     - href:"#"
     - window.location.href
     - window.location.replace
     - <a href="/  (internal routes)
   - Replace internal anchors with <Link> equivalents.
   - Replace window.location.* internal navigations with router navigation (setLocation or Link).
   - Keep logo click routing to "/".
   - Do NOT change any link labels/copy.

2) RESPONSIVE CONTAINMENT FIX (apply globally + targeted)
   - Update ONLY styles/utilities (no layout redesign).
   - Add global CSS safety in client/src/index.css:
     - Ensure all elements respect container width
     - Enable safe wrapping for long text
   - Add a small reusable utility class approach (Tailwind classes or CSS) and apply to:
     - Cards
     - Section containers
     - Any flex row that contains text

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Global CSS additions (index.css)
Add rules that prevent overflow and enforce wrapping, e.g.:
- html, body { overflow-x: hidden; }
- * { box-sizing: border-box; }
- p, h1..h6, li, a { overflow-wrap:anywhere; word-break:break-word; }
- Ensure media elements are responsive (img, video max-width:100%)

B) Tailwind continuity rules to apply where needed (do not blanket-rewrite everything):
- For flex parents with text children: add "min-w-0" to the child that contains text
- For text blocks: add "break-words" (and/or "break-all" only if necessary)
- For cards/containers: ensure "overflow-hidden" where appropriate (only if Figma visually clips)

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (MUST DO)
- Run the app and manually test:
  1) Navbar links (desktop + mobile hamburger) across all pages
  2) Logo click returns to "/"
  3) No page jumps from "#" links
  4) No full reload navigation for internal links
  5) Resize browser width from 320px to 1440px:
     - No horizontal scrolling
     - No text spilling outside cards/sections/buttons
- Report:
  - Exact files changed
  - Line ranges
  - A short checklist confirming validations passed
