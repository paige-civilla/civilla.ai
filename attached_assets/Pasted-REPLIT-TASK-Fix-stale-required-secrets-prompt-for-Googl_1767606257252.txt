REPLIT TASK: Fix stale “required secrets” prompt for Google Vision OCR (service-account keys)

Problem
Replit is showing an outdated Secrets request modal for:
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CLIENT_EMAIL
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_PRIVATE_KEY
But the codebase has already switched Vision OCR auth to REST API key auth and DOES NOT use those variables anymore. Replit’s “requested secrets” UI is stale.

Goal
1) Ensure the app ONLY requires one secret:
   - GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY
2) Remove/disable any remaining code paths, logs, docs, or prompts that reference the old 3 secrets.
3) Update the health endpoint and startup logging to reflect ONLY api-key auth.
4) Provide a clear in-app/UI message: “OCR not configured. Add GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY in Replit Secrets.”

What to change (do ALL)

A) Remove all “service account” secret references from code
Search the entire repo and remove references to:
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CLIENT_EMAIL
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_PRIVATE_KEY
Also remove any code that does newline replace for private keys, JSON credential parsing, or @google-cloud/vision client initialization.

B) Make the Vision config check ONLY look for the API key
In server/services/evidenceExtraction.ts (or wherever Vision config is checked):
- isVisionConfigured() must return true ONLY if process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY is present
- Do NOT fallback to GOOGLE_API_KEY
- Do NOT consider service-account secrets at all

C) Update startup log to reflect ONLY api-key auth
In server/index.ts (startup logging):
Log exactly:
- “Vision OCR configured: true/false (auth=api-key)”
Do not mention service account keys.

D) Update /api/vision/health
Keep it requireAuth.
It should:
- return { ok: false, error: "missing GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY" } if missing
- return { ok: true } after successfully making a tiny annotate request (or a safe client init)
Do not expose any secret values.

E) Update Evidence UI error handling
In client/src/pages/AppEvidence.tsx:
If OCR fails due to missing key or 401/403:
Show: “OCR is not configured yet. Add GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY in Replit Secrets.”

F) Remove old “3-secret request” language from any README/docs/prompts
Search for the old secret names in markdown, comments, and any internal helper text and delete/update it.

G) Confirm in your response
After implementing, report:
- Files changed
- Count of remaining matches for the three old secret names (should be 0)
- Confirm the ONLY secret needed is GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY
- Confirm /api/vision/health behavior with key missing vs present

Note
This will not directly change Replit’s cached “Secrets requested” modal UI, but by removing all references and standardizing to a single secret, future prompts and runtime behavior will match the correct configuration and users won’t be misled.
