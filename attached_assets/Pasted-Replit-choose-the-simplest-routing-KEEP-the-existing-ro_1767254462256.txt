Replit, choose the simplest routing: KEEP the existing route /app/messages/:caseId but replace the page content and all labels from “Messages” to “Pattern Analysis”. Do NOT add a new /app/patterns route yet and do NOT add redirects yet.

Implement Parts A + B + C exactly as described below, with this routing decision applied.

PART A — Dashboard calendar “Upcoming” list + cross-module completion sync
[KEEP EXACTLY AS PREVIOUS BLOCK: items 1–5]

PART B — Categories + create-from-dashboard + user-defined colors
[KEEP EXACTLY AS PREVIOUS BLOCK: items 6–10]

PART C — Pattern Analysis placed where Messages is (rename + wiring), no AI
11) Rename all UI labels:
- App navbar dropdown item label “Messages” -> “Pattern Analysis”
- Dashboard module tile “Messages” -> “Pattern Analysis”
- Case workspace module tile “Messages” -> “Pattern Analysis”

12) Routing decision (IMPORTANT):
- KEEP route /app/messages/:caseId
- KEEP any API routes that might exist for messages, but do not use them in the UI
- Render the new Pattern Analysis page component at /app/messages/:caseId

13) Implement Pattern Analysis page with real data hooks (no AI):
- Page title: Pattern Analysis
- Subtitle: Spot trends across tasks, deadlines, and timeline over time.
- Sections:
  A) By Category summary:
     - counts of upcoming items by category across tasks+deadlines+calendar_items
  B) Overdue / At Risk:
     - overdue deadlines + overdue to-dos
  C) Recent Activity:
     - last 10 created/updated items across tasks/deadlines/calendar_items/timeline_events (if timeline exists)

14) Ensure Pattern Analysis uses APP theme tokens:
- No bg-bush in authenticated app pages
- Primary buttons use bg-primary/text-primary-foreground

DELIVERABLES
- Dashboard shows month calendar with dots + “Upcoming” list underneath (no dead space).
- Checking off an item in Upcoming updates the source module and reflects everywhere.
- Users can add items from dashboard and create categories with a color wheel.
- “Modules” heading removed, “Case Workspace” small label removed, “View all cases” is a button.
- /app/messages/:caseId now shows Pattern Analysis with real data.

After implementation, provide screenshots of:
- Dashboard with Upcoming list populated
- Creating a new category + calendar item from dashboard
- Toggling completion from dashboard and seeing it in the source module
- Pattern Analysis page populated
