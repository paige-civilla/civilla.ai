BUILD NEXT PAGE: Legal + Compliance (Civilla)

AUTONOMY: LOW
- Do not invent features.
- Do not change global layout/styles.
- Match existing Figma/Relume design tokens + typography + spacing.
- Reuse existing layout components (Navbar, Footer, PageHeader, ContentSection, RichText, TableOfContents if present).
- Keep tone calm, educational, not salesy.
- No emojis.

GOAL
Create a “Legal & Compliance” public page that explains what Civilla is, what it is not, UPL boundaries, privacy/safety, and user rights—clearly and reassuringly. This page must reduce legal risk and increase user trust.

ROUTE + FILE
- Add route: /legal-compliance
- Create page file: client/src/pages/LegalCompliance.tsx
- Add nav/footer link label: “Legal & Compliance” (if nav has a Legal dropdown/section, place it there; otherwise add to footer Legal column)

PAGE STRUCTURE (must include these sections, in this order)

1) Hero
- Title: “Legal & Compliance”
- Subtitle: “How Civilla stays educational, research-driven, and safe.”
- Small callout: “Civilla is not a law firm. Not legal advice.”

2) Table of contents (sticky on desktop if your system supports it)
Anchors:
- Not Legal Advice
- How Civilla Helps
- Research & Sources
- User Control & Confirmations
- Document Drafts & Watermarks
- Privacy & Data Handling
- Safety Features
- Refund Policy (summary)
- Contact & Support

3) Not Legal Advice (UPL boundary)
Include clear bullets:
- Civilla is an educational and organizational platform.
- Civilla does not provide legal advice and does not replace a lawyer.
- Civilla does not guarantee outcomes.
- Users make final decisions and control what gets filed/sent.

Add the required disclaimer text EXACTLY:
“Prepared using Civilla for educational and research purposes. Not legal advice.”

4) How Civilla Helps (plain language)
Bullets:
- Explain court processes in plain language
- Organize case information (timeline, tasks, evidence)
- Provide checklists and education
- Generate educational draft documents for the user to review/edit
- Provide reminders only with user opt-in and confirmation

5) Research & Sources (research-driven promise)
Explain:
- When Lexi provides legal info, it should cite sources.
- Civilla can link to official sources and reputable references.
- If sources aren’t available, it says so rather than guessing.

NOTE: Do not implement web browsing here—just explain the concept. No fake citations.

6) User Control & Confirmations
Explain:
- Users confirm key information (dates, deadlines, extracted info).
- Users approve anything saved into timeline/exhibits/drafts.
- Optional notifications (email/SMS) are opt-in and can be toggled off.

7) Document Drafts & Watermarks
Explain:
- Drafts include visible “Educational Draft / Not a Court Filing” watermark unless the user explicitly acknowledges required disclaimers (paid flow).
- Free tier can generate a sample draft but cannot download and watermark is permanent.
- Users are responsible for reviewing and complying with court rules.

8) Privacy & Data Handling (high level)
Include:
- Data minimization
- Security basics (sessions, encryption at rest/in transit if applicable to your stack—keep it non-technical)
- User rights: export/delete requests (if supported)
- Voice and media consent: opt-in required for transcription or media analysis; explain what happens to audio/video/text

9) Safety Features
Include:
- Quick Exit
- Discreet design
- Links to safety resources (DV help) with “Civilla is not an emergency service”
- Encourage contacting local emergency services if in immediate danger

10) Refund Policy (summary)
Add the short copy used on pricing:
“Subscriptions are non-refundable. Refunds may be issued only for billing errors, service unavailability, or where required by law.”
Link to /terms for the full policy.

11) Contact & Support
Provide:
- “Report a problem” link to existing /feedback if present
- If no feedback page exists, create a simple contact section that says: “Use the in-app feedback form.”

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Must be fully responsive and not overflow at any viewport width.
- Use consistent container widths and spacing like Home/Plans pages.
- Use headings hierarchy (H1/H2/H3), short paragraphs, bullet lists.
- Avoid aggressive warnings; keep calm and clear.
- Ensure anchor links work.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the page component
- Register the route in App.tsx
- Add link in footer (and nav if appropriate)
- Confirm files changed and provide quick summary of what was added
