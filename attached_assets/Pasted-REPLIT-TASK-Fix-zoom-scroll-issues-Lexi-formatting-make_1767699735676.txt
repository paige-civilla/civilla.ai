REPLIT TASK: Fix zoom/scroll issues + Lexi formatting + make source links truly external + speed improvements

Priority A — Fix “boxes don’t resize / can’t scroll to button” on zoom
1) Add a single layout rule in AppLayout (or the main authenticated content wrapper):
   - The main content area must be constrained to viewport height minus navbar.
   - Ensure content scrolls within the page region.

Implementation guidance:
- In AppLayout.tsx (or equivalent), wrap the page content in a container like:
  - className="min-h-[calc(100vh-var(--app-nav-h))] max-h-[calc(100vh-var(--app-nav-h))] overflow-y-auto"
- If you don’t have a CSS var for navbar height, define one and set it where navbar renders (e.g., 64px).
- For long forms (Onboarding, Create Case, Evidence modals, etc.), ensure the form container has:
  - max-h: 70–80vh
  - overflow-y-auto
  - and the submit button row is either inside the scroll or sticky:
    - className="sticky bottom-0 bg-[...] border-t [...]"

Acceptance test:
- Zoom browser to 125%, 150%, 175%
- Confirm you can always scroll to the primary button and click it.

Priority B — Lexi responses: readable formatting like ChatGPT
1) Enforce a structured output style in the Lexi system prompt:
   - short paragraphs
   - bullets when listing
   - headings when helpful
   - always include blank lines between sections
   - never produce a single long paragraph

2) Ensure the Lexi message renderer preserves formatting:
Option 1 (preferred): Render markdown (react-markdown) with safe defaults.
Option 2: If no markdown renderer, at minimum wrap assistant message content with:
  - className="whitespace-pre-wrap leading-6"
  - and add spacing between paragraphs.

Acceptance test:
- Ask Lexi a multi-part question
- Confirm output shows bullets, paragraph breaks, and readable sections.

Priority C — Fix “Sources” links opening 404 / base site
Root cause: external URLs are being handled by the SPA router (wouter Link) or being normalized incorrectly.

Implement:
1) In Lexi message rendering, treat URLs as external:
   - Use <a href="FULL_URL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">...</a>
   - DO NOT use wouter <Link> for external URLs.
2) If you have a “Sources” section UI, ensure it stores full URLs and opens them externally.
3) In Lexi research mode prompt, require:
   - full absolute URLs starting with https://
   - no shortened or implied paths
   - no “base domain + path” reconstruction by frontend

Acceptance test:
- Trigger research mode answer with 3–5 sources
- Click each source and confirm it opens the exact referenced page in a new tab (no 404).

Priority D — Make Lexi feel faster (without breaking quality)
1) Enable streaming in Lexi chat route:
   - Use OpenAI streaming (stream: true)
   - Send tokens to client as they arrive (SSE)
   - Update LexiPanel to render partial text as it streams in.
2) Model strategy:
   - Default “Chat” mode uses a faster model (e.g., gpt-4o-mini).
   - “Research” mode uses the higher quality model only when needed.
3) Reduce latency:
   - cap max_output_tokens
   - keep context injection concise (only top N relevant items)
   - cache research answers (already have case_rule_terms; reuse it)

Acceptance test:
- Send a normal chat question: first token appears quickly
- Send a research question: shows streaming progress, still returns Sources.

- files changed
- what CSS/layout change fixed zoom + scroll
- how Lexi formatting is enforced (prompt + renderer)
