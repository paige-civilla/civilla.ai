REPLIT AGENT TASK: Fix Case Settings routing, add onboarding entry point, close Lexi on outside click, update dashboard title copy, convert AppNavbar menu to hover

SCOPE: Client-side fixes + route wiring only. No backend required unless the Case Settings page doesn’t exist yet.

A) FIX "CASE SETTINGS" MENU ROUTE
1) Find the AppNavbar dropdown menu items.
   Likely file: client/src/components/AppNavbar.tsx (or similar).
2) Locate the Case Settings item. It is currently navigating to the case dashboard route.
3) Update it to navigate to:
   /app/case-settings/:caseId
   (If your app uses a different pattern like /app/cases/:caseId/settings, use that instead — but be consistent with Router routes.)

4) Ensure there is a matching route in your router:
   - Find routing file (likely client/src/App.tsx or client/src/router.tsx).
   - Add route:
     path="/app/case-settings/:caseId"
     element={<AppCaseSettings />}  (or whatever component exists/you create below)

5) If AppCaseSettings page does not exist, create a placeholder:
   File: client/src/pages/AppCaseSettings.tsx
   - Use AppLayout
   - Show heading "Case Settings"
   - Show basic case fields (title, state, county, caseType) as read-only for now (or editable if already built elsewhere)
   - This prevents dead routing and confirms nav works.

B) ONBOARDING: DEFINE WHERE IT STARTS
Goal: After login, if user has no cases, send them to create case page.

1) Identify the first authenticated landing page after login:
   - likely /app/dashboard or /app/cases
2) Add a guard:
   - If cases query returns empty array, redirect to:
     /app/cases/new   (or whatever your create-case route is)
3) If /app/cases/new does not exist, route them to /app/cases and open the create-case dialog automatically if you already have one.

C) LEXI: CLICK OUTSIDE CLOSES PANEL
1) Locate Lexi panel component (or where it is rendered globally in AppLayout).
2) When Lexi is open, render a full-screen overlay BEHIND Lexi but ABOVE the page:
   <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/0 z-40" onClick={() => setIsLexiOpen(false)} />
   - z-index: overlay should be less than Lexi panel (Lexi panel should be z-50)
   - overlay background should be transparent (bg-black/0) so it doesn’t dim.

3) Ensure Lexi panel container has z-50 and is positioned fixed on right.

D) DASHBOARD COPY CHANGE
1) Find the dashboard/case workspace page component (likely client/src/pages/AppCase.tsx).
2) Replace:
   "You're in your Case Workspace"
   with:
   "Your Case Workspace"
3) Capitalization exactly: "Your Case Workspace"
4) Leave the subtitle line as-is unless there is another instruction.

E) APPNAVBAR MENU: HOVER TO OPEN (DESKTOP) + CLICK STILL WORKS (MOBILE)
1) In AppNavbar dropdown:
   - Add state: const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
2) On the menu trigger wrapper (NOT the button alone), implement:
   onMouseEnter={() => setOpen(true)}
   onMouseLeave={() => setOpen(false)}
3) Keep click toggle for mobile:
   onClick={() => setOpen(v => !v)}
4) Ensure dropdown renders when open === true.
5) Add a small close delay OPTIONAL to prevent flicker when moving mouse from button to dropdown:
   - Use a timeout ref:
     - onMouseLeave => set timeout 150ms to close
     - onMouseEnter => clear timeout
6) Make sure accessibility remains:
   - pressing Escape closes
   - focus/blur does not instantly close if user tabs into dropdown (optional, but try not to break)

DELIVERABLES
- List files changed
- Confirm Case Settings now routes to Case Settings page (not dashboard)
- Confirm Lexi closes when clicking outside panel
- Confirm dashboard title reads "Your Case Workspace"
- Confirm hover menu works on desktop and tap works on mobile
- Provide screenshots of:
  - dropdown open on hover
  - case settings page loaded
  - Lexi open with click-outside closing
