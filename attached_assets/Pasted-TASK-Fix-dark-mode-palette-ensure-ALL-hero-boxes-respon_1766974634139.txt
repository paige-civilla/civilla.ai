TASK: Fix dark mode palette + ensure ALL hero boxes respond to theme (no partial switching)

AUTONOMY: LOW

SYMPTOMS:
- Dark mode looks bad.
- Only some hero boxes change in dark mode; others stay light.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change layout structure, spacing, or copy.
- Only change theme tokens + hero box styling so dark mode is consistent.
- Do NOT introduce new features or pages.

ROOT CAUSE (LIKELY):
- Some hero boxes are using hardcoded classes (bg-cream/bg-white/border-neutral-*/hex) instead of semantic tokens.
- Dark theme tokens in index.css are not tuned for Civilla’s palette.

GOAL:
1) Dark mode palette should match Civilla: deep near-black background, clean off-white text, bush green accents.
2) 100% of hero boxes must switch correctly because they all use the same semantic token classes.

STEP 1 — TUNE TOKENS (ONLY TOKENS)
File: client/src/index.css
In :root (light) keep existing values unless necessary.
In .dark, set tokens to these exact values (or closest HSL equivalents if tokens use HSL):
- --background: near #070503
- --foreground: near #fcfbf9
- --card: slightly lighter than background (near #0b0a09 or #0f0d0c)
- --card-foreground: same as foreground
- --border: subtle light border (white at ~10–16% opacity equivalent)
- --muted / --muted-foreground: neutral readable (don’t go gray-on-gray too low contrast)
- --primary should remain bush green family (but not neon)
Make sure text contrast is strong.

STEP 2 — HERO BOX CONTINUITY RULE
Find the hero “boxes” used across marketing pages and app pages.
They must ALL use ONLY semantic classes:
- bg-card
- text-card-foreground
- border border-border
and NO hardcoded background/border colors (no bg-cream, bg-white, bg-[#...], border-neutral-darkest/20, etc).

If hero boxes are repeated as JSX blocks, create ONE presentational component:
client/src/components/HeroBox.tsx (or similar)
Props: title, body, optional children
Default wrapper classes:
"rounded-2xl border border-border bg-card text-card-foreground"
Then replace all hero boxes to use this component so every box follows the same theme behavior.

STEP 3 — AUDIT + REPLACE
Repo-wide search for hero box wrappers and replace their className to remove hardcoded colors.
Specifically search for:
- bg-cream
- bg-white
- bg-[#
- border-neutral
- text-neutral-darkest
Only replace within hero box containers / hero card containers (do not touch unrelated UI).

STEP 4 — VERIFY
- Toggle dark mode: EVERY hero box background/border/text switches.
- No box remains white/cream in dark mode.
- No contrast issues (body text readable).

DELIVERABLE:
- List every file changed (file + line ranges).
- Confirm the new hero box continuity rule is enforced by using semantic tokens or the shared HeroBox component.
