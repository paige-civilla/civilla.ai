REPLIT AGENT TASK: Update Footer Across All Pages (Single Source Footer Component)

GOAL
Make the footer clean, consistent with the new navbar IA, and remove duplicate/odd link groupings.
This should update across all pages by editing the shared Footer component only.

FILE TO EDIT
client/src/components/Footer.tsx

WHAT TO CHANGE

1) COLUMN HEADERS + LINK GROUPS (REPLACE CURRENT FOOTER NAV LISTS)
Use exactly these 3 columns and link labels:

COLUMN 1 HEADER: “Product”
Links (in this order):
- Home → /
- Plans & Pricing → /plans
- How Civilla Works → /how-civilla-works
- About Us → /about

COLUMN 2 HEADER: “Trust & Safety”
Links:
- Safety & Support → /safety-support
- Legal & Compliance → /legal-compliance
- Accessibility → /accessibility

COLUMN 3 HEADER: “Help”
Links:
- Contact → /contact
- Privacy Policy → /privacy-policy
- Terms of Service → /terms
- Login → /login

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include “Legal” as a separate link. Use “Legal & Compliance” only.
- Do NOT include “Safety” as a separate link. Use “Safety & Support” only.
- Ensure all internal links use the existing routing component (wouter <Link href="...">).

2) REMOVE DUPLICATE BOTTOM LINK LIST
In the screenshot, the footer shows:
- a column list of Privacy/Terms/etc
AND ALSO
- a separate bottom list of “Privacy Policy / Terms of Service / Legal & Compliance”
Remove the bottom duplicate link list so links appear only once (in the columns).

3) COPYRIGHT LINE
Set the copyright line to:
“© 2025 civilla.ai. All rights reserved.”
(Keep casing exactly as shown unless the project already uses a different canonical style.)

4) MOBILE SPACING / READABILITY (LIGHT POLISH ONLY)
Without changing overall styling, ensure:
- Columns stack nicely on mobile (gap/spacing consistent)
- Link lists have consistent vertical rhythm (no cramped lines)

VERIFY
- Footer looks updated on every page that uses <Footer />
- No duplicated “Privacy Policy / Terms / Legal & Compliance” links at the bottom
- Routes all work (tap each on mobile preview)
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- Exact line ranges changed in Footer.tsx
- Confirm the footer is used site-wide (no other footer variants)
