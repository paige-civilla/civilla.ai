REPLIT AI — MAKE 2 CHANGES (HOMEPAGE + PLANS FEATURES)

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE (navbars, footer, other homepage sections, layouts). Only do what’s requested below.

========================================================
A) HOMEPAGE — ADD NEW DROPDOWN ITEM IN THIS HERO BOX
========================================================

1) Find the component for the homepage hero section in the screenshot by searching these exact strings:
- "Your Case Journey"
- "Your Evidence Timeline"
- "Your Pattern Analysis"
- "Your Research Assistant"
- "Your Document Builder"

Use ripgrep:
rg -n "Your Case Journey|Your Evidence Timeline|Your Pattern Analysis|Your Research Assistant|Your Document Builder" client/src

2) Open the file where those strings live. You’ll see either:
- an array of accordion items (preferred), OR
- hardcoded <AccordionItem> blocks.

3) Add a NEW accordion item directly after “Your Pattern Analysis” (or anywhere that fits visually):

TITLE:
Your Child Support Estimator

BODY (match the tone/length of the others):
Get an educational estimate range using guideline-style equations and the information you enter. This is not court-accurate and not legal advice.

If the accordion is driven by an array like:
const items = [{ title: "...", body: "..." }, ...]

Add this object:
{
  title: "Your Child Support Estimator",
  body: "Get an educational estimate range using guideline-style equations and the information you enter. This is not court-accurate and not legal advice."
}

If it’s hardcoded AccordionItem blocks, add a block that matches the existing structure, e.g.:
<AccordionItem value="child-support-estimator">
  <AccordionTrigger>Your Child Support Estimator</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    Get an educational estimate range using guideline-style equations and the information you enter. This is not court-accurate and not legal advice.
  </AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

========================================================
B) PLANS & PRICING — ADD “CHILD SUPPORT ESTIMATOR” TO ALL TIERS
(Trial, Core, Pro, Premium)
========================================================

4) Find the plan tier definitions and feature comparison data:
rg -n "Trial|Core|Pro|Premium|Full Feature Comparison|feature comparison|planTiers|tiers" client/src/pages/Plans.tsx client/src/pages/plans.tsx client/src/pages/Plans.ts client/src/pages/plans.ts

5) Add the feature label to EACH plan card’s 6 highlights list (Trial/Core/Pro/Premium).
Use this exact highlight text (NO parentheses):
Child support estimate range

6) Add the same feature to the Full Feature Comparison section:
- If you still have a Trial column in the table: mark it ✓ for Trial/Core/Pro/Premium.
- If you REMOVED the Trial column (as discussed earlier): add this to the “Trial callout” block above the table, in the list of what the trial includes.

Trial callout line to add (no parentheses):
Includes child support estimate range using the information you enter. Not court-accurate. Not legal advice.

7) Save and verify:
- Homepage accordion now has “Your Child Support Estimator” with the disclaimer language.
- Plans page: all 4 plan cards show “Child support estimate range” in highlights.
- Feature comparison area reflects the feature as included for all tiers (and trial callout if trial column isn’t shown).

END.
