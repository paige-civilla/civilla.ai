REPLIT AGENT TASK: Improve Public Menu Organization + Add Column Header Icons + Clean Up CTA Headline

GOALS
1) Make the public dropdown menu more visually pleasing and better organized.
2) Add small outline icons to each menu column header (Lucide icons).
3) Ensure “Get Started” routes to /plans (Plans & Pricing).
4) Replace the CTASection headline/subhead with cleaner, more hopeful copy.

FILES TO EDIT
- client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
- client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx
- client/src/components/CTASection.tsx

PART A — MENU INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (NAVBAR + NAVBARCREAM)
1) In BOTH Navbar.tsx and NavbarCream.tsx, update the public dropdown menu grouping to these columns:

COLUMN 1 HEADER: “Start Here” (add Lucide icon Sparkles or Flag)
Links:
- Home ( / )
- Plans & Pricing ( /plans )
- How Civilla Works ( /how-civilla-works )

COLUMN 2 HEADER: “About Civilla” (add Lucide icon Info or HeartHandshake)
Links:
- About Us ( /about )

COLUMN 3 HEADER: “Trust & Safety” (add Lucide icon ShieldCheck)
Links:
- Safety & Support ( /safety-support )
- Legal & Compliance ( /legal-compliance )
- Accessibility ( /accessibility )

COLUMN 4 HEADER: “Support” (add Lucide icon LifeBuoy)
Links:
- Contact ( /contact )
- Privacy Policy ( /privacy-policy )
- Terms of Service ( /terms )
- Login ( /login )

2) Keep “FAQ (Coming Soon)” and “Resources (Coming Soon)” but visually de-emphasize:
- Place them under a “Learn” area OR at the bottom of “Start Here”
- Keep them disabled
- Style: smaller + muted (opacity) so they don’t clutter

3) Add/keep a PRIMARY CTA button labeled “Get Started” in the navbar that routes to /plans (public funnel). Do not add signup/onboarding routes.

4) Add small outline icons ONLY next to the column headers (not next to every link).
Use lucide-react icons already used elsewhere in the project if available.

PART B — CTA SECTION COPY CLEANUP
FILE: client/src/components/CTASection.tsx

1) Replace the headline/subhead with this (keep styling/layout):
Headline line 1: “Start With Clarity”
Headline line 2: (remove the second headline line entirely if possible; otherwise set it to empty or delete it)
Subhead: “You don’t have to figure this out alone. Learn in plain language, research with Lexi, and stay organized — at your pace.”

2) Buttons:
- Primary button text stays “Get Started” and MUST route to /plans
- Secondary button text stays “How Civilla Works” and routes to /how-civilla-works

VERIFY
- Menu looks less chunky, better grouped, and icons appear beside headers
- “Get Started” goes to /plans everywhere
- CTA section reads clean and hopeful
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- Exact files and line ranges changed
- Confirm routing targets for both CTA buttons
