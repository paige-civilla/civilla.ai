REPLIT TASK (CIVILLA REBUILD) — LEGAL & COMPLIANCE PAGE CLEANUP + ADD TO GLOBAL FAQ PAGE
IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT edit: Home page, How Civilla Works page, Plans & Pricing page, Footer, Green Navbar, Cream Navbar styling/branding.
- ONLY touch files required for:
  (1) /legal-compliance page layout/content cleanup
  (2) /faq page creation/enablement and FAQ compilation
- Keep existing images on /legal-compliance exactly as they are (do not remove/replace assets), unless an image is currently broken.
- Remove “button-happy” CTAs on /legal-compliance (no Learn/Read buttons). Replace with simple text links/jump links only.

GOALS:
A) Legal & Compliance page should feel like: “Legal & Compliance + What we do / don’t do + Privacy basics + Document draft disclaimers + Not emergency service”
B) Make the language legally safe across *all* states/territories by being clear, general, and avoiding jurisdiction-specific promises.
C) Any FAQs on /legal-compliance must also be included on the global /faq page.
D) Enable the /faq page (remove “Coming soon” behavior for FAQ nav link). Resources can remain “Coming soon”.

------------------------------------------------------------
1) FIND/CONFIRM ROUTES + FILES
- Search for route “/legal-compliance” and identify the page component file (likely: client/src/pages/LegalCompliance.tsx or similar).
- Search for any existing FAQ page route or placeholder (likely: /faq).
- Search for any existing accordion component used on plans/support/legal pages (Radix Accordion, shadcn/ui accordion, or custom).

------------------------------------------------------------
2) LEGAL & COMPLIANCE PAGE — RESTRUCTURE (NO MORE EXTRA BUTTONS)
In the /legal-compliance page component:
- Keep the existing hero image sections (same images/visuals), but remove the “Learn / Read” style buttons entirely.
- Replace buttons with:
  - A simple “On this page” jump-link row (plain text links, not buttons) that scrolls to sections:
    • Education only
    • What we can / can’t do
    • Privacy basics
    • Documents & court use
    • Common questions

PAGE COPY (use this exact wording unless you must adjust for component constraints):

SECTION 1 (Hero / top):
Title: “Legal & compliance”
Subtitle: “Clear boundaries, plain language, and what civilla can—and cannot—do.”

SECTION 2 (Education only):
Title: “Education only. Never legal advice.”
Body:
“civilla is an educational and organizational platform. We are not a law firm, we do not provide legal advice, and we do not represent you in court. Using civilla does not create an attorney–client relationship.”

SECTION 3 (What we can / cannot do):
Title: “What we can and cannot do for you”
Body (short intro):
“Understanding these limits helps you use civilla safely—especially when rules vary by state, county, and judge.”
Bullets (use icons if you already have them, otherwise plain list):
✅ We can explain legal terms and typical court processes in plain language.
✅ We can help you organize information, documents, timelines, and notes you provide.
✅ We can surface general educational information and options to consider.
🚫 We cannot tell you what you should do in your specific case.
🚫 We cannot tell you what to file, when to file it, or how to argue it.
🚫 We cannot predict outcomes, guarantee results, or communicate with the court for you.

SECTION 4 (Privacy basics):
Title: “Privacy basics”
Body:
“We treat your information with care and limit access to what’s needed to operate civilla. We do not sell your personal information. For full details, refer to our Privacy Policy.”
NOTE: Do NOT claim “history is cleared” or “no record remains” unless that is truly implemented and verified.

SECTION 5 (Documents & court use):
Title: “Documents and court use”
Body:
“Documents generated in civilla are educational drafts and may include disclaimers/watermarks. You are responsible for reviewing, editing, and confirming any document meets your local court’s rules and filing requirements. If you can, consult a licensed attorney for legal advice.”

SECTION 6 (Not an emergency service — if already present on this page, keep but tighten copy):
Title: “civilla is not an emergency service”
Body:
“If you are in immediate danger, call local emergency services. If you need crisis support, contact local hotlines available in your area.”

SECTION 7 (FAQ accordion on this page):
- Keep FAQ accordion style, but:
  - Remove redundant headings like “Questions” + “Common questions answered” (pick ONE).
  - Keep it clean: one heading + one sentence + accordion.
Use this heading:
Title: “Common questions”
Subtitle: “Answers about how civilla works and what it cannot do.”

LEGAL-SAFE FAQ ITEMS (add these if missing; keep existing if already matches):
1) “Can civilla give me legal advice?”
Answer:
“No. civilla is for education and organization. We do not provide legal advice or representation, and we do not tell you what decisions to make in your case.”
2) “Is my information private?”
Answer:
“We limit access to your information to operate civilla. We do not sell your personal information. See our Privacy Policy for details.”
3) “What if I need a real lawyer?”
Answer:
“civilla does not replace a lawyer. If you need legal advice or representation, consult a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction. civilla can help you organize materials you may share with a lawyer.”
4) “Can I use civilla’s documents in court?”
Answer:
“civilla’s documents are educational drafts. You are responsible for ensuring anything you file meets your court’s rules and requirements.”
5) “Who decides what I do with my case?”
Answer:
“You do. civilla provides information and organization tools; you remain in control of your decisions.”

------------------------------------------------------------
3) GLOBAL /FAQ PAGE — ENABLE + COMPILE ALL FAQs
Create (or finalize) a dedicated FAQ page at route: /faq

Implementation approach:
- Create a single source of truth for FAQs:
  - Add file: client/src/content/faqs.ts (or /data/faqs.ts)
  - Export sections as arrays:
    - legalComplianceFaqs
    - plansPricingFaqs (pull from the Plans page FAQ accordion)
    - safetySupportFaqs (pull from Safety/Support page accordion if it has Q/A items)
- On /faq page, render:
  - Page title: “FAQs”
  - Subtitle: “Quick answers about what civilla does—and what it doesn’t.”
  - Section headings for each group (Legal & compliance, Plans & pricing, Safety & support)
  - Accordion UI for each section
- IMPORTANT: do not duplicate identical questions—dedupe by question string.

Also:
- After you update the /legal-compliance FAQs, ensure they are included in legalComplianceFaqs so they appear on /faq automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------
4) NAVBAR — MAKE FAQ LIVE (BUT DO NOT CHANGE NAV STYLING)
- Locate NavbarCream.tsx and Navbar.tsx menu definitions where FAQ is currently disabled “Coming soon”.
- Change FAQ item to an active link to “/faq” and remove disabled/coming soon UI for FAQ only.
- Leave “Resources” as disabled/coming soon.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) STYLE RULES (KEEP THE CIVILLA LOOK)
- Do NOT introduce frosted/transparent navbar styling.
- Keep typography, spacing, and line dividers consistent with existing marketing pages.
- Replace “Learn/Read” buttons on /legal-compliance with simple text jump links and clean section spacing.

------------------------------------------------------------
6) DELIVERABLES
After changes, output:
- Files changed list
- New routes added/confirmed
- Screenshot notes (what sections exist and where jump links go)
- Confirm:
  ✅ /legal-compliance has no extra CTA buttons
  ✅ /faq page exists and aggregates FAQs
  ✅ Navbar FAQ is clickable and no longer “coming soon”
