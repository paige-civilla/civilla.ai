REPLIT TASK: Fix Create Case 500 (missing column "starting_point")

Problem
POST /api/cases fails with:
column "starting_point" does not exist (Postgres 42703)

Root cause
The code now writes a "startingPoint" field (DB column starting_point) when creating cases,
but the deployed Neon "cases" table was created before this column existed.

Goal
1) Add starting_point column to cases table in production safely.
2) Keep shared/schema.ts in sync so Drizzle + types match.
3) Ensure create-case works even if old DB is missing columns (defensive migration on startup).

Do ALL:

A) Update shared/schema.ts (cases table)
1) Find the cases table definition.
2) Add a new nullable column:
   startingPoint: text("starting_point")   // nullable
   (If you prefer an enum later, keep it text for now.)
3) Ensure any Case insert/update zod schemas allow it as optional.

B) Add DB startup migration in server/db.ts (no drizzle push required)
We already do runtime table creation/migration patterns in this app.
Add a small "ensureCasesColumns" step that runs on startup:

1) After connecting to the DB (same place other CREATE TABLE / ALTER TABLE logic happens),
   run a query that checks if the column exists:
   SELECT 1
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name='cases' AND column_name='starting_point';

2) If it does NOT exist, run:
   ALTER TABLE cases ADD COLUMN starting_point text;

3) This must be safe to run multiple times (only add if missing).

C) Ensure server/storage.ts createCase uses the correct field mapping
1) Confirm the insert statement includes startingPoint only if present in the input,
   mapping to starting_point automatically via Drizzle.
2) If any raw SQL uses "starting_point", keep it as-is once the column exists.

D) Verify
1) Restart the workflow.
2) Create a case from the UI.
3) Confirm server log no longer shows 42703 and POST /api/cases returns 200 with new case id.

E) Report back
When done, tell me:
- Files changed
- Confirmation that cases.starting_point exists (log a one-time debug: “cases.starting_point present: true”)
- Create case now works

Implementation notes (important)
- Do NOT drop tables.
- Do NOT reset the database.
- This is a production-safe additive migration only.
