REPLIT AGENT TASK: Fix Mobile Layout For StepsSection (Left “Step One/Two/Three” Column + Right Copy Column Aligned Per Row)

GOAL
On MOBILE, the “Step One / Step Two / Step Three” section should NOT stack the step labels on top and then the paragraphs below (it looks messy).
Instead, MOBILE should render as 3 ROWS:
- Left side: Step label (vertical list)
- Right side: The matching paragraph aligned with that step
On DESKTOP, keep the current 3-column layout with the single underline.

FILE TO EDIT
client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx

INSTRUCTIONS
1) Open client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx
2) Create a single data structure at the top of the component (or reuse what exists) so we have one source of truth:

const STEPS = [
  { label: "Step One", body: "Choose your state and case type. Civilla surfaces educational information and typical court steps for that jurisdiction and case category." },
  { label: "Step Two", body: "Add your documents, messages, and key events. Civilla organizes what you provide into a clear timeline so you can review everything in context." },
  { label: "Step Three", body: "Get plain-language explanations of common stages and what information people typically prepare — without legal advice or outcome promises." },
];

(Use the exact text already in the file so we don’t accidentally change copy.)

3) Implement RESPONSIVE RENDERING:

A) MOBILE VIEW (md:hidden)
Render 3 rows where each row is a 2-column grid:
- Left column: the step label (bold, Title Case)
- Right column: the paragraph
Example structure (adapt classNames to match your styling, but keep this layout):

<div className="md:hidden">
  <div className="space-y-10">
    {STEPS.map((s) => (
      <div key={s.label} className="grid grid-cols-[110px,1fr] gap-6 items-start">
        <div className="font-semibold text-lg text-neutral-900">{s.label}</div>
        <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">{s.body}</p>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT show the “Step One / Step Two / Step Three” header stack on mobile anymore.
- No underline needed on mobile (optional: add a thin divider between rows if it looks nicer, but not required).

B) DESKTOP VIEW (hidden md:block)
Keep the existing desktop layout:
- Step labels across the top in 3 columns
- One continuous underline across all 3 columns
- 3 paragraphs in 3 columns below

Wrap the current desktop markup in:
<div className="hidden md:block"> ...existing desktop layout... </div>

4) Keep the small disclaimer line at the bottom as-is, but ensure it sits below both mobile and desktop layouts and remains centered.

VERIFY
- Mobile: you see 3 rows with “Step One” left + matching paragraph right, perfectly aligned.
- Desktop: the existing 3-column header + single underline + 3 paragraphs remains unchanged.
- No buttons appear in this section.
- No lint/type errors.

REPORT BACK
- Exact line ranges changed
- Confirm tested in mobile preview + desktop preview
