TASK: Fix 500 error when creating a Timeline event (POST) on production domain

AUTONOMY: LOW
CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change UI styling, layout, or copy
- Only touch backend/routes/storage/schema/migrations/observability needed to fix the 500
- Keep existing API shape unless absolutely required

USER-REPORTED BUG:
Clicking "Create an event" on /app/timeline/:caseId throws 500 in production.

GOAL:
Creating a timeline event returns 200 and persists to DB for that caseId, on civilla.ai (deployment).

STEP 1 — Identify the failing request + stack trace
1) In Replit Deployments -> Logs, reproduce the error by clicking "Create an event".
2) Find the exact failing endpoint and error message/stack trace.
   - Confirm it is the timeline create endpoint (POST) and capture:
     - request path
     - status code
     - error string (ex: relation "timeline_events" does not exist)
     - any SQL error codes

STEP 2 — Add minimal diagnostics (safe, no secrets)
Add GET /api/health/timeline that:
- requires auth
- runs a simple DB query that proves the timeline table exists (ex: SELECT 1 FROM timelineEvents LIMIT 1)
- returns 200 { ok:true } if query works
- returns 500 { ok:false, error:"<safe error>" } if it fails
Do NOT include credentials in errors.

STEP 3 — Fix the root cause (most likely: production DB missing table)
If logs show table missing / migration missing:
- Ensure timelineEvents table exists in shared/schema.ts (already added)
- Apply schema/migrations to PRODUCTION DATABASE used by deployments
  - If using Drizzle:
    - run the appropriate migration/push step that this repo uses (drizzle-kit push or migrations)
  - Verify by re-running /api/health/timeline and confirming ok:true

If logs show route mismatch:
- Confirm frontend calls the same route you implemented in server/routes.ts
- Align the server route path to the frontend call (or vice versa), minimal change only

If logs show case ownership / parsing error:
- Log the received payload keys (safe) to confirm required fields exist
- Add validation: return 400 with a clear message if required fields are missing/invalid (instead of 500)

STEP 4 — Validate on the LIVE deployment
After fix + republish:
- On civilla.ai:
  - Create a timeline event -> should succeed
  - Refresh -> event persists
  - /api/health/timeline -> returns { ok:true }

DELIVERABLE:
- Report exactly what the error was (one sentence, no secrets)
- List files changed with line ranges
- Confirm production DB schema now includes timelineEvents
