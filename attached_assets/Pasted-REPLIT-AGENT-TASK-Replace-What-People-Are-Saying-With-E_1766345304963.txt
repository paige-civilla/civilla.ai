REPLIT AGENT TASK: Replace “What People Are Saying” With “Early Notes” (Anonymous) + Add Simple Feedback Submit Box (Non-Logged-In)

GOAL
We don’t have real public reviews yet. Convert the Home “testimonials” section into:
- Anonymous “Early Notes” (clearly labeled as early access)
- No star ratings, no fake names, no avatars
- Add a small feedback submit box (name optional, email optional, message required)
- Submit should email support@civilla.ai via mailto OR post to an existing feedback endpoint if one already exists
  (Prefer a real endpoint if available; otherwise mailto fallback)

STEP 1 — FIND THE SECTION FILE
Search:
rg -n "What people are saying|Sarah M\\.|James T\\.|Maria L\\.|Self-represented parent|Here\\'s what they have to say|★★★★★" client/src

Open the component/file that renders this section on Home.

STEP 2 — UPDATE SECTION HEADING + SUBHEAD
Replace:
Heading: “What people are saying”
Subhead: (current)

With:
Heading: “Early Notes”
Subhead:
“We’re in early access. Here’s the kind of feedback we’re hearing — and what we’re building toward.”

STEP 3 — REPLACE THE 3 CARDS (ANONYMOUS NOTES)
For each of the three cards:
- REMOVE star row
- REMOVE avatar image
- REMOVE person name + “Self-represented parent”
- Replace with:

CARD 1
Quote:
“I needed a calmer way to understand what’s typical — without feeling judged or overwhelmed.”
Attribution line (small/muted):
“Anonymous — Early Access”

CARD 2
Quote:
“Having my notes, messages, and documents in one place made it easier to stay organized.”
Attribution:
“Anonymous — Early Access”

CARD 3
Quote:
“The plain-language explanations helped me feel less panicked about what comes next.”
Attribution:
“Anonymous — Early Access”

(Keep the same card layout/styling as much as possible; just swap content.)

STEP 4 — ADD FEEDBACK SUBMIT BOX UNDER THE CARDS
Directly below the cards, add a small “Share Your Thoughts” box.

Title:
“Share Your Thoughts”

Helper text:
“Your feedback helps us improve Civilla. No legal details needed — just what felt helpful or what felt confusing.”

Fields:
- Name (optional)
- Email (optional)
- Message (required) — textarea

Submit button text:
“Send Feedback”

SUBMISSION BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)
A) First, check if a public feedback endpoint already exists:
Search:
rg -n "/api/feedback|feedback|Send Feedback" server client/src

If a suitable endpoint exists (public, no-auth), POST JSON:
{ name, email, message, source: "home_early_notes" }

B) If no endpoint exists, implement a mailto fallback:
On submit, build:
mailto:support@civilla.ai
subject: "Civilla Early Access Feedback"
body includes Name/Email/Message (URL-encoded)
Open via window.location.href = mailto...
Also show a small note under the button:
“This will open your email app.”

VALIDATION
- Require message (non-empty)
- Disable submit button if message is empty
- On success (POST) show a simple “Thanks — we got it.” confirmation
- If using mailto, no success state required beyond opening the email client

UPL SAFETY NOTE
Do NOT ask for case details. Do NOT frame it as legal advice. Keep copy focused on product experience.

VERIFY
- Section no longer resembles real reviews (no stars, no names/photos)
- Cards read as anonymous early access notes
- Feedback form works (endpoint OR mailto fallback)
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- File edited + line ranges
- Whether an endpoint existed (and which) OR confirm mailto fallback implemented
- Show the final text used in the section
