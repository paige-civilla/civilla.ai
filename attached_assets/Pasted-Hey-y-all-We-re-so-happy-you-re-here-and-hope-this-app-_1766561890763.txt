Hey y'all! We're so happy you're here and hope this app supports you in the ways you need.

A bit about us: we're both single parents who went through the trenches, learned a lot along the way, and wanted to create something truly helpful for others on the same journey.
(Fun fact: people always assume we're together... we're not. We're simply two parents who became best friends through our kids and this chapter of life. We joke that we're "cousins — not kissing cousins," even though we're not actually related.)

A Note from Our Founder
Family court wasn't built for people like us — people who can't afford a lawyer at the rate of a used Honda every week (no offense, attorneys), who are juggling work and kids and healing and maybe three hours of sleep. People who didn't remarry a millionaire for financial stability, and who are just trying to raise their kids in peace while someone else keeps yanking the legal system like it's a slot machine.
I know this world too well.
I've been through the divorce, the aftermath, the endless paperwork that feels like death by a thousand paper cuts. I've done the late-night cry-in-the-car sessions after holding it together all day. I've lived in that foggy limbo where you're trying to parent, survive, grow, and defend yourself — all in the same week — while wishing someone, anyone, could just explain what the hell is going on.
The truth is, I didn't create civilla.ai because I'm a tech founder who saw a "market opportunity." I created it because I was a parent who felt overwhelmed, under-resourced, and expected to magically understand a system that speaks in riddles. I built it because I needed clarity, calm, and a place to land when everything felt like chaos. I built it because so many of us are fighting quiet battles in courts that rarely make space for our humanity.
All of us, me and you, deserve steadiness, understanding, and a sense of direction — especially when life is pulling you in every possible direction at once.
Go kick some bureaucratic ass — kindly, strategically, and with receipts.

P.S. When I say "I built it", I do actually mean WE built this, B. I had the idea, and you believed in me— AND the idea.

A Note from Our Co-Founder
A few years ago, I went through one of the hardest things anyone can face — divorce. It tested my strength, my patience, and my sense of fairness. I learned that real strength isn't loud or aggressive — it's steady, grounded, and focused on what matters most: my child, and the relationship I want to build and protect with them.
Like many fathers, I discovered how confusing, costly, and one-sided the process can feel. But as I moved through it, I also began to understand experiences that weren't like my own. Divorce hits everyone differently. There are two sides to every ending, and most people — no matter which side they're on — are just trying to hold themselves together while navigating something they never imagined they'd be in.
That's why we built this idea into reality — so fathers, mothers, and families could finally have a tool that brings clarity, organization, and calm to the chaos. It keeps you steady, helps you save money (hopefully), and gives you the confidence to advocate for yourself and your kids during a time when everything feels uncertain.
I came out of that chapter stronger, calmer, and more grounded — not just for myself, but for my son.
