REPLIT AGENT TASK: Upgrade Quick Exit Destinations (Random Neutral Pages + Mid-Page Anchors) Without Breaking Back-Button Safety

GOAL
Quick Exit should NOT go to Google. It should send users to a RANDOM, neutral, “safe to be seen on” page (works for anyone), ideally landing mid-page. It MUST still prevent returning to Civilla via the browser Back button (keep using window.location.replace).

FILES TO EDIT
1) client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
2) client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx

DO NOT CHANGE
- The Quick Exit button placement or icon
- The use of window.location.replace (keep it)

INSTRUCTIONS
1) In BOTH files, locate:
const handleQuickExit = () => {
  window.location.replace("https://www.google.com");
};

2) Replace that implementation with the following (same function name):

const handleQuickExit = () => {
  const safePages = [
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#Preparation",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea#Preparation",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houseplant#Care",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking#Health_benefits",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe#Ingredients",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Recommendations",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather#Forecasting",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography#Digital_photography",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music#Elements",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking#Techniques",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book#Structure",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise#Health_effects"
  ];

  const destination = safePages[Math.floor(Math.random() * safePages.length)];
  window.location.replace(destination);
};

3) Ensure the code compiles in BOTH navbars (no unused vars, no lint errors).

VERIFY
- Clicking Quick Exit navigates away immediately.
- Refreshing and clicking again lands on different pages sometimes (random).
- Pressing Back does NOT return to Civilla (replace() preserved).
- Works on desktop and mobile.

REPORT BACK
- Confirm both files updated
- Provide exact line ranges changed in each file
