Replit — Fix Lexi panel sizing/position so it does NOT cover the whole page and is usable.

Goal (Desktop):
- When Lexi is OPEN, show it as a “floating side panel” on the right, NOT full height and not edge-to-edge.
- It should be centered vertically, with breathing room around it:
  - Leave ~24px (about “an inch” visually) from the top and bottom of the viewport
  - Leave ~24px from the right edge
- Width should be about 25–30% of the page (or clamp for usability):
  - Use: width: clamp(320px, 28vw, 460px)
- Height should be less than full viewport so user can always see the page behind:
  - Use: height: calc(100vh - 48px)
- Add a subtle shadow and rounded corners so it reads like a floating panel.
- The message list must scroll, not the entire page, and the input must always be visible.

Mobile:
- Keep current mobile behavior OR make it full-screen modal on very small screens, but:
  - Input must always be visible
  - Chat must be scrollable

Where to change:
- Lexi panel component (likely):
  client/src/components/lexi/LexiPanel.tsx  (or similar)
Search for the container that positions the panel (look for fixed/right-0/top-0/h-screen/w-...).

Exact changes:
1) Change the OPEN panel wrapper from “full height sidebar” to floating card:

Replace something like:
  className="fixed right-0 top-0 h-screen w-96 ..."
with:
  className="
    fixed
    right-6 top-6 bottom-6
    w-[clamp(320px,28vw,460px)]
    rounded-2xl
    shadow-lg
    border
    overflow-hidden
    z-50
    flex flex-col
    bg-background
  "

(Keep your border color tokens—use your existing border token so it matches the theme.)

2) Ensure internal layout uses flex so the input stays accessible:
- Header: shrink-0
- Messages area: flex-1 overflow-y-auto
- Composer/input: shrink-0

Example structure inside panel:
<div className="flex flex-col h-full">
  <div className="shrink-0">...header...</div>
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">...messages...</div>
  <div className="shrink-0 border-t">...input...</div>
</div>

3) If the messages container currently has no scrolling, add:
  className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0"
(min-h-0 is important for flex children to allow scrolling.)

4) Make sure nothing else is forcing the panel to exceed viewport:
- Remove any h-screen/h-full mismatch inside nested containers that causes overflow.
- The outer wrapper should control the height via top/bottom.

5) Quick check that Lexi is actually working (no UI guessing):
- Add a small “Status” line in the Lexi header temporarily (remove later):
  - On open, call GET /api/lexi/health
  - Show “Lexi: Connected” or “Lexi: Not configured”
This confirms backend is responding and the OpenAI key is set.

Acceptance tests:
- Open Lexi: panel appears as a floating card on the right with margins.
- You can always see the input box and type.
- Messages scroll inside the panel.
- Page behind remains visible around Lexi (top/bottom/right margins).
- /api/lexi/health returns ok:true and the UI shows Connected.

After implementing:
Paste back ONLY the Lexi panel wrapper div (the outermost container) and the messages/input container section so I can verify the flex + scrolling is correct.
