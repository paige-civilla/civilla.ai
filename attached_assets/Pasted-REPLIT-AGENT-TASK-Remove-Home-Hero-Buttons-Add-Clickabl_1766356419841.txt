REPLIT AGENT TASK: Remove Home Hero Buttons + Add Clickable “Scroll to learn more ↓” That Smooth-Scrolls To Second Hero Box

GOAL
- Remove the two big hero buttons (“Explore”, “Sign Up”) from the Home hero
- Replace them with a subtle clickable text cue: “Scroll to learn more ↓”
- Clicking the cue smooth-scrolls to the SECOND hero box section on the Home page

FILES TO EDIT
- client/src/pages/Home.tsx
- client/src/components/ClaritySection.tsx  (this is the second hero box on Home)

PART A — ADD A SCROLL TARGET ID TO THE SECOND HERO BOX
1) Open: client/src/components/ClaritySection.tsx
2) Find the OUTERMOST wrapper element returned by the component (the top-level <section> or <div>).
3) Add an id attribute:
   id="home-learn-more"
Example:
<section id="home-learn-more" ...>   OR   <div id="home-learn-more" ...>

PART B — REMOVE HERO BUTTONS AND ADD THE SCROLL CUE
4) Open: client/src/pages/Home.tsx
5) Locate the first hero area (the section containing the headline “Family law, translated.”).
6) Find the button group that renders “Explore” and “Sign Up”.
7) Delete that entire button group.
8) In its place, add a small clickable element under the headline, like:

- Text: “Scroll to learn more ↓”
- Style: small, subtle, not a button (text-sm, underline, opacity)
- On click: smooth-scroll to the element with id="home-learn-more"

Use this exact click handler in React:
onClick={() => {
  document.getElementById("home-learn-more")?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "start" });
}}

Suggested Tailwind classes (adjust only if needed to match existing spacing):
className="mt-6 inline-flex cursor-pointer items-center gap-2 text-sm underline underline-offset-4 opacity-80 hover:opacity-100"

PART C — VERIFY
9) Reload Home:
- Confirm the hero no longer shows the two big buttons
- Confirm “Scroll to learn more ↓” appears instead
- Tap it on mobile: it scrolls smoothly to the second hero box (ClaritySection)
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- Exact line ranges changed in Home.tsx and ClaritySection.tsx
- Confirm scroll target lands at the top of the second hero box
