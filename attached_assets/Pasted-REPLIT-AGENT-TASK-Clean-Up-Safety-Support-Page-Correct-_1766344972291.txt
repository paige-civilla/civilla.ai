REPLIT AGENT TASK: Clean Up Safety & Support Page (Correct Resources, Remove Placeholder Help Number, Add Clear Non-Emergency Support)

GOAL
Update the Safety & Support page so it:
- Clearly states Civilla is not an emergency service
- Uses general, reliable resources (no state-by-state list)
- Removes any fake/placeholder “Help Center” phone section
- Keeps support@civilla.ai as non-emergency contact

STEP 1 — FIND THE FILE
Search:
rg -n "Safety\\b|In crisis|support@civilla\\.ai|Help Center|Hotline|1-800-799|911" client/src

Open the page component that renders the Safety & Support screen (likely a file named SafetySupport.tsx or similar under client/src/pages).

STEP 2 — REPLACE THE TOP HERO COPY
Replace the current hero area text with:

PAGE EYEBROW (small/top label, if present):
“Safety”

MAIN HEADING:
“In Crisis”

BODY PARAGRAPH (replace the current paragraph):
“If you’re in immediate danger, call 911 (or your local emergency number). Civilla is not an emergency service. Use Quick Exit if you need to leave this site quickly.”

(Keep Quick Exit wording simple and direct.)

STEP 3 — FIX / REPLACE THE CARDS (Resources / Support / Hotline)
A) RESOURCES CARD
Title: “Resources”
Body: “Learn about safety planning and find support options in your area.”
Link text (internal): “Safety & Support”
(If this links to the same page you’re on, remove the link and keep it as plain text.)

B) SUPPORT CARD (CIVILLA SUPPORT — NON-EMERGENCY)
Title: “Civilla Support”
Body: “For account or site issues (non-emergency), email us anytime.”
Link: “support@civilla.ai” as a mailto link:
href="mailto:support@civilla.ai"

C) CRISIS SUPPORT (US) CARD
Title: “Crisis Support (U.S.)”
Body: “Call or text 988 for free, confidential support 24/7.”

D) DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUPPORT (US) CARD
Title: “Domestic Violence Support (U.S.)”
Body (use exactly):
“National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233. Text ‘START’ to 88788. Chat available at TheHotline.org.”

OPTIONAL (if you have room as a second line under that card):
“You can also search their directory of local providers for help in your area.”

STEP 4 — REMOVE THE PLACEHOLDER HELP CENTER SECTION
Remove any section that:
- says “Help Center”
- shows a phone number you don’t own
- repeats “Visit our Help Center for answers”

Do NOT leave broken links.

STEP 5 — FINAL SAFETY LINE (BOTTOM OF PAGE)
Add a small, muted line at the bottom:
“Civilla provides educational, research, and organizational support — not legal advice or representation.”

VERIFY
- Page reads cleanly on mobile (no duplicated headings/links)
- No placeholder phone numbers remain
- support@civilla.ai opens email composer
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- File edited + exact line ranges changed
- Confirm which sections were removed
