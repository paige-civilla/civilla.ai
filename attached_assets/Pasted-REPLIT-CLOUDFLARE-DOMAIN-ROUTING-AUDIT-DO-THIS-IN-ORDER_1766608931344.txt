REPLIT + CLOUDFLARE DOMAIN + ROUTING AUDIT (DO THIS IN ORDER)

A) DOMAIN / DNS (works now even if registrar transfer must wait 60 days)
1) In Replit:
   - Open the Deployment for the website.
   - Go to Settings → Custom Domains.
   - Add BOTH:
     - civilla.ai
     - www.civilla.ai
   - Replit will show:
     - an A record target (an IP)
     - a TXT record for verification (host/name + value)

   NOTE: Replit custom domains use ONLY A records (not CNAME), require the TXT verification,
         and do NOT support AAAA records.  [oai_citation:1‡Replit Docs](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/custom-domains)

2) In Cloudflare DNS (for the zone civilla.ai):
   - Create/confirm these DNS records:
     a) A    @      → <REPLIT_IP_FROM_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SCREEN>   (Proxy OFF / DNS only / grey cloud)
     b) A    www    → <REPLIT_IP_FROM_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SCREEN>   (Proxy OFF / DNS only / grey cloud)
     c) TXT  <whatever Replit says> → <whatever Replit says>   (Proxy doesn’t apply to TXT)

   IMPORTANT:
   - If Cloudflare is proxying (orange cloud), Replit warns SSL/cert renewals can fail.
     Keep these records DNS-only.  [oai_citation:2‡Replit Docs](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/custom-domains)
   - Remove any AAAA records for @ or www (Replit does not support AAAA).  [oai_citation:3‡Replit Docs](https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/custom-domains)

3) Canonical domain (pick one):
   - Choose ONE as canonical: either https://civilla.ai OR https://www.civilla.ai
   - In Cloudflare: add a Redirect Rule to 301 the non-canonical to canonical:
     - if you pick www: redirect civilla.ai/* → https://www.civilla.ai/$1
     - if you pick apex: redirect www.civilla.ai/* → https://civilla.ai/$1

B) MAKE “PATHWAYS EXIST” (NO MORE /route 404s ON HARD REFRESH)
Goal: any public page like /legal-compliance, /privacy-policy, /contact, /accessibility must load
even if the user lands there directly from Google.

1) In the server (Express) that serves the frontend:
   - Ensure static assets are served
   - Ensure SPA fallback exists AFTER all API routes:

   Example (adjust paths to your build output):
   ------------------------------------------------
   // API routes first
   app.use("/api", apiRouter);

   // Frontend static
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../client/dist")));

   // SPA fallback (MUST be last)
   app.get("*", (req, res) => {
     res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../client/dist/index.html"));
   });
   ------------------------------------------------

2) Verify that /api/* still returns API responses, and everything else returns index.html (200).

C) QUICK ROUTE AUDIT (FRONTEND “IS EVERYTHING WIRED?”)
1) Confirm the site routes exist in ONE source of truth:
   - Search the codebase for: createBrowserRouter, Routes, Route, or your routes config.
   - Make a list of public routes you expect:
     /, /how-civilla-works, /plans, /legal-compliance, /privacy-policy, /terms, /accessibility, /contact, /faq, etc.

2) Run this manual smoke test (in browser + mobile):
   For EACH route:
   - open it normally (clicking from nav)
   - then hard refresh on that page (pull-to-refresh / Cmd+R)
   - confirm it still loads (no 404)

3) If ANY route 404s on refresh:
   - The SPA fallback in section B is missing or not last.

D) COPY/STYLE FIXES YOU ASKED FOR (FAST)
1) Headings + button text:
   - Set hero headings to Title Case (Each Word Capitalized)
   - Button labels Title Case too
   - Remove duplicate CTAs per hero:
     - Keep ONE primary action per hero (or ONE primary + ONE text link max)
     - Everything else becomes inline links further down the page

2) “CAN / CANNOT” sections (less wordy):
   Replace with:
   - "What We Can Do"
     • Explain how family court generally works
     • Define legal terms in plain language
     • Help you organize information and documents
     • Show common options and what they usually require
   - "What We Can’t Do"
     • Tell you what to file, when to file, or what to say in court
     • Give case-specific recommendations
     • Contact the court or the other party for you
     • Represent you or act as your lawyer

E) 60-DAY TRANSFER NOTE (SO YOU DON’T WORRY)
- You can keep the domain at GoDaddy and use Cloudflare DNS + Replit today.
- The “60 days” restriction is about transferring the domain to a different registrar soon after registration/transfer/registrant-change.  [oai_citation:4‡The Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-transferring-domains-to-cloudflare/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
