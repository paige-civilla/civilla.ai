TASK: Phase A — Add 4 Court-Formatted DOCX Templates (Same Format as Declaration-4)

AUTONOMY: LOW
SCOPE: DOCX GENERATION ONLY (no UI redesign, no styling changes to marketing pages)

GOAL
Add 4 new court-formatted DOCX templates that match the existing “Declaration-4” output exactly in:
- Times New Roman, 12 pt
- Double-spaced body text
- Same caption/header layout (party info + court info)
- Same caption table / box alignment
- Same page numbering placement
- Same signature block placement and style

NEW TEMPLATES TO ADD
1) Affidavit
2) Motion
3) Memorandum
4) Certificate of Service

NON-NEGOTIABLE FORMATTING RULES
- Use the same document builder logic, margins, spacing, fonts, and layout constants as Declaration-4.
- Do NOT “approximate” formatting. Clone the working template generator and only change text content.
- Keep everything visually identical except:
  - Document title (e.g., “AFFIDAVIT”, “MOTION”, etc.)
  - Default placeholder body text

WHERE THESE SHOULD APPEAR
On the existing Documents page, in the same place the current “Download DOCX (Court Format)” / generator is exposed.
If there is a “New Document” modal/dropdown already:
- Add these 4 items to that selector.
Otherwise:
- Add 4 additional buttons near the existing court format action, using the same button style and spacing.

DATA INPUT
Use the same payload schema currently used for the court doc generator:
- court: { district, county, state }
- case: { caseNumber }
- parties: { petitioner, respondent }
Also include the user signature block exactly like Declaration-4 supports:
- If user is pro se: show “Petitioner, Pro Se” (or “Respondent, Pro Se” if that option exists; if not, keep Petitioner)
- If attorney flow exists: keep placeholder attorney block but do not invent new UI for attorney selection in Phase A

DEFAULT BODY PLACEHOLDERS (COPY)
AFFIDAVIT body placeholder should start like:
1. I am the Petitioner in this matter and I am over the age of 18 years.
2. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein.
3. [Add your statements of fact here, each as a numbered paragraph.]
4. [Include specific dates, times, and details where relevant.]

MOTION body placeholder should start like:
COMES NOW the Petitioner, and hereby moves the Court for an Order granting the following relief:
1. [State the specific relief requested.]
2. [State additional requests.]
This Motion is supported by the attached Declaration/Affidavit and any accompanying exhibits.

MEMORANDUM body placeholder should start like:
I. INTRODUCTION
[Write a brief introduction.]
II. FACTS
[Summarize the relevant facts.]
III. ARGUMENT
[Explain the legal argument and why the Court should grant the requested relief.]
IV. CONCLUSION
[State the requested outcome.]

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE body placeholder should start like:
I certify that on this ____ day of __________, 2025, I served a true and correct copy of the foregoing [Document Title] upon:
[Name]
[Address]
via [ ] U.S. Mail  [ ] Hand Delivery  [ ] Email  [ ] Other: __________

DATED this ____ day of __________, 2025.
[Your Full Name]
Petitioner, Pro Se

BACKEND/API
- If the current generator endpoint only supports “Declaration”, extend it to accept a template type parameter, e.g. templateType = "declaration" | "affidavit" | "motion" | "memorandum" | "certificate_of_service"
- Or create separate endpoints per template if simpler, but keep it consistent and minimal.

VALIDATION TESTS (MUST PASS)
1) Generate each of the 4 templates and open in Word:
   - Font is Times New Roman 12 everywhere (including caption text)
   - Body is double-spaced
   - Caption layout matches Declaration-4
   - Signature block matches Declaration-4
   - Page number placement matches Declaration-4
2) No console errors in browser
3) No server errors during generation

DELIVERABLE
- Report exact files changed + line ranges
- Confirm templates are accessible from Documents page
- Provide the route/endpoint(s) and example request payload(s)
- Confirm formatting matches Declaration-4 (not “close” — identical)
