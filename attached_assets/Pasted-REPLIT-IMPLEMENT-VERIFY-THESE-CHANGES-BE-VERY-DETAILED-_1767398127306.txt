REPLIT — IMPLEMENT + VERIFY THESE CHANGES (BE VERY DETAILED IN YOUR SUMMARY)

CONTEXT
- App has authenticated “Dashboard” and “Onboarding” flows.
- We need to fix dashboard layout + calendar UX + module ordering, and confirm onboarding has the full in-depth flow + a warning up front that it is lengthy.
- After changes, you MUST test and list exact files/lines changed and what each change does. Include before/after behaviors.

PART 1 — DASHBOARD LAYOUT + CALENDAR UX FIXES (REQUIRED)

A) Calendar sizing + balance
1) On Dashboard, make layout balanced:
   - Left column: Month calendar + “Upcoming” list beneath it
   - Right column: Module tiles grid
2) Ensure the calendar is not too tall or stretched:
   - Calendar container should look like about half the screen width on desktop (balanced with modules)
   - Avoid big empty dead space beneath the calendar

B) Add “Upcoming” list under calendar (limit 7)
1) Under the month calendar, add a section title: “Upcoming”
2) Show the next 7 soonest upcoming items across:
   - Deadlines
   - Case To-Do items (tasks)
   - Calendar items (custom events)
3) Each row should show:
   - Title
   - Date
   - Category/type indicator (deadline / to-do / calendar)
   - Optional colored dot matching the category color rules already used on the calendar
4) Allow user “dopamine rush” check-off:
   - If it’s a Case To-Do item: clicking checkbox marks the task completed (and it disappears or moves to done)
   - If it’s a Deadline: allow marking “Done” (set deadline done/completed)
   - If it’s a Calendar item: allow marking “Done” if model supports it, otherwise leave non-checkable
5) Completion must reflect across modules:
   - If completed in Upcoming list, it must show completed in the Tasks module and/or Deadlines module accordingly.

C) Remove unwanted headings
1) Remove the word “Modules” above the module tiles on the dashboard.
2) Remove the small “Case Workspace” title above the case section (user requested it be removed).

D) View All Cases button styling
1) “View All Cases” must be a smaller button (not huge)
2) Give it a strong/dark outline (border color #1E2020) OR make it the same style as Lexi’s dark button (primary), whichever looks best with the palette.
3) It should be visually clear and not dominate the header.

E) Module tile order + visuals
1) Re-order module tiles so it matches typical workflow priority:
   Suggested order (edit if you think better, but explain why):
   - Evidence
   - Timeline
   - Exhibits
   - Documents
   - Case To-Do
   - Deadlines
   - Pattern Analysis
   - Case Settings / Children / Account (if shown as tiles)
2) Module tiles should NOT be overly long/tall; tighten spacing.
3) Ensure module tile background/border colors match the internal app palette:
   - Background should be #FAF8F4 (page) not overly blue
   - Tile interior can be #A2BEC2 or other approved app-surface
   - Borders use #1E2020 or #A2BEC2 per our latest direction

F) Navbar icon responsiveness when zooming out
1) Fix AppNavbar icons so they don’t overflow or misalign when user zooms out.
2) Add sensible responsive rules:
   - icons shrink or wrap
   - spacing reduces
   - label text truncates
3) Must look correct at 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% zoom.

G) Calendar corner “gap” fix
1) User reported top corners/headers of calendar have a visible gap between rounded corners.
2) Identify the specific CSS causing this and fix so the header area looks seamless (no corner spacing glitch).

PART 2 — ONBOARDING: FULL FLOW + WARNING + REVIEW STEP + PERSISTENCE (REQUIRED)

A) Pre-onboarding warning screen / intro step
1) After account creation (first login), before step 1, show an onboarding intro panel:
   - Message like: “This will take a bit of time, but it will save you time later by auto-filling your documents and organizing your case.”
   - A “Start Onboarding” button
   - A “Do this later” option ONLY if allowed by product decision; if not allowed, explain why.
2) Make sure it always scrolls to TOP when entering a new step (fix issue where next step starts at bottom).
3) Also ensure when closing agreement modals, the page does NOT jump to bottom.

B) Confirm onboarding includes “Review & confirm” step
1) Add a “Review & confirm” step before Agreements:
   - Show summary of entered info (profile, address, case details, children)
   - Highlight missing items with “Missing” badges
   - Provide “Edit” links that jump back to the relevant step
2) Then proceed to Agreements.

C) Agreements step (must be enforced)
1) Ensure checkboxes cannot be checked until the user scrolls to the bottom of each agreement modal:
   - Terms of Service
   - Privacy Policy
   - Not legal advice / no representation acknowledgement
   - Release/limitation acknowledgement (whatever wording currently exists)
2) User must complete all required agreements to finish onboarding.

D) Onboarding completion persistence
1) Confirm: once onboarding is completed, user is routed to Dashboard on future logins (never forced back into onboarding).
2) Confirm: if onboarding incomplete, user is routed to onboarding before accessing app modules (unless you have a specific allowed bypass).

E) “I don’t know yet” buttons
1) For fields that are realistically unknown (case number, opposing counsel info, etc.), provide “I don’t know yet” / “Don’t have yet” option.
2) These should record as deferred fields and show “Missing” badges later in Account Settings or Case Settings.

PART 3 — TESTS + VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)

A) Manual test checklist — you MUST run these and report results
1) Dashboard:
   - Calendar balanced with modules
   - Upcoming list shows next 7 items
   - Completing from Upcoming updates Tasks/Deadlines
   - “Modules” heading removed
   - “Case Workspace” small title removed
   - View All Cases button is small + outlined or primary style
   - Navbar icons responsive at 80% and 110% zoom
   - Calendar header corners show no gap
2) Onboarding:
   - Intro warning appears before onboarding
   - Each step starts at top (no jump to bottom)
   - Agreement modals do not jump to bottom after closing
   - Review & confirm step exists before Agreements
   - Agreements require scroll-to-bottom before checkbox enabled
   - Completing onboarding routes to dashboard and stays that way on refresh + re-login

B) Replit summary must be extremely detailed
In your final summary, include:
- Exact files edited
- What changed in each file
- Any new components created
- Any new API endpoints added (if any)
- Any database changes (if any)
- Before/after behavior notes
- Proof of tests (what you clicked, what you saw, responses)

DO NOT:
- Change marketing (pre-login) styling except onboarding intro screen itself
- Rename routes unless necessary
- Remove existing functionality
