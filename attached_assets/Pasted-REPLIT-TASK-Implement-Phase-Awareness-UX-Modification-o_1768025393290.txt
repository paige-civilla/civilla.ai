REPLIT TASK: Implement “Phase Awareness UX” (Modification-of-Custody style) — ONE PASS, NO QUESTIONS

GOAL
Add a calm, non-annoying “Current stage” indicator across the app so users understand where they are in the Evidence → Claims → Draft flow. It should update automatically based on existing Draft Readiness stats. No popups, no spam, no blocking except where already required.

WHAT TO BUILD (END STATE)
1) Backend: /api/cases/:caseId/draft-readiness response must include a new field:
   - phase: "collecting" | "reviewing" | "draft-ready"
   Logic:
   - if readinessPercent >= 80 AND acceptedClaims > 0 => "draft-ready"
   - else if totalClaims > 0 => "reviewing"
   - else => "collecting"

2) Frontend: Show this phase in THREE places:
   A) Dashboard (top of page, above cards):
      - “Current stage: Collecting & organizing your case” + short subtitle
      - “Current stage: Reviewing claims” + short subtitle
      - “Current stage: Draft-ready” + short subtitle
      Use a simple small text block (not a banner) and DO NOT block anything.

   B) Document Creator (Compile from Claims tab):
      Above the Compile button, show a short notice based on phase:
      - collecting: “Not draft-ready yet — and that’s expected… Civilla drafts from reviewed, cited info.”
      - reviewing: “Almost draft-ready… review remaining claims to enable drafting.”
      - draft-ready: “Draft-ready… this draft is built from approved claims + linked evidence.”
      Keep it short, readable, with paragraph breaks.

   C) Evidence/Claims UI (where Suggested/Accepted Claims are shown):
      Show ONE time per case per browser session (sessionStorage) a single-line reassurance:
      “Suggestions are based on your evidence. Nothing is used unless you approve it.”
      Do NOT show it every time; only once per session per case.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT ASK ME)
Backend
- Create file: server/services/phaseResolver.ts
  Export:
    type CasePhase = "collecting" | "reviewing" | "draft-ready"
    function resolveCasePhase({ acceptedClaims, totalClaims, readinessPercent }): CasePhase (logic above)

- In server/routes.ts, locate the existing GET /api/cases/:caseId/draft-readiness handler.
  After stats are computed, compute:
    const phase = resolveCasePhase({ acceptedClaims: stats.acceptedClaims, totalClaims: stats.totalClaims, readinessPercent: stats.readinessPercent })
  Return JSON including phase:
    res.json({ ...stats, phase })

Frontend
- Create file: client/src/components/app/PhaseStatusBar.tsx
  It accepts prop phase and renders:
    Line 1: “Current stage: …”
    Line 2: subtitle (small, muted)
  Copy:
    collecting:
      title: “Collecting & organizing your case”
      subtitle: “Drafting becomes available after claims are reviewed.”
    reviewing:
      title: “Reviewing claims”
      subtitle: “You’re almost ready to draft.”
    draft-ready:
      title: “Draft-ready”
      subtitle: “Documents are generated from approved claims and linked evidence.”

- Dashboard:
  In the dashboard page component (where draft readiness is already queried), render:
    <PhaseStatusBar phase={draftReadiness.phase} />
  Place it at the top of the main content area.

- Document Creator:
  In client/src/pages/AppDocuments.tsx (Compile from Claims tab), add a small component or inline block:
    If phase === "collecting": show the “Not draft-ready yet…” message
    If phase === "reviewing": show the “Almost draft-ready…” message
    If phase === "draft-ready": show the “Draft-ready…” message
  Insert ABOVE the compile button.

- Evidence/Claims one-time reassurance:
  In the component that renders claims sections (EvidenceViewer / AppEvidence claims panel),
  add:
    const key = `claims-reassurance-shown-${caseId}`;
    if (!sessionStorage.getItem(key)) show message and then set it immediately.
  Only show when claims UI is visible.

REQUIREMENTS
- No new database tables.
- No new popups or modals.
- Keep styling consistent with existing typography + spacing.
- Must compile and run after change.
- Update any types if needed so TS is happy.

DELIVERABLE
After implementation, reply with:
- files changed
- exact copy shown in each phase
- confirm /draft-readiness now returns phase
