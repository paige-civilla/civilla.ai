REPLIT AGENT TASK: Make Mobile Menu Section Headings + Divider Lines Bold + Use Distinct Icons For “About Civilla” Items

GOAL
In the mobile dropdown menu:
1) Section headings (e.g., “ABOUT CIVILLA”, “TRUST & SAFETY”) should look bolder/more prominent.
2) The thin line under each section heading should be bolder/darker.
3) The “About Civilla” *items* must use different icons (not the same icon as the section header).

FILES TO EDIT
- client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
- client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx

PART A — UPDATE ICONS FOR ABOUT CIVILLA ITEMS (BOTH FILES)
1) In BOTH Navbar.tsx and NavbarCream.tsx, update lucide imports to include:
- Target (for Our Mission)
- Users (for Meet The Founders)
- Info (or UserRound) (for About Us)
Keep the existing section header icon for About Civilla as: Info (or whatever it currently is).

2) Find the menu link objects for the “About Civilla” section items:
- Our Mission → /about#mission
- Meet The Founders → /about#founders
- About Us → /about

3) Replace their icons so they are distinct:
- Our Mission: Target
- Meet The Founders: Users
- About Us: Info (or UserRound if you prefer a person icon)
IMPORTANT: Do NOT change labels or routes—icons only.

PART B — MAKE SECTION HEADINGS BOLD (BOTH FILES)
4) Locate the JSX that renders section headings like:
“ABOUT CIVILLA”, “TRUST & SAFETY”, “SUPPORT”, etc.

5) Update the heading className so it is visibly bold:
- Add/ensure: font-bold
- Increase tracking slightly if desired, but keep the same vibe:
  tracking-widest uppercase text-xs font-bold
- Darken heading text a bit if it’s too light:
  text-neutral-800 (instead of text-neutral-700)

PART C — MAKE THE UNDERLINE/DIVIDER UNDER HEADINGS BOLDER (BOTH FILES)
6) Locate the underline element directly beneath each section heading (currently a thin line like bg-black/10).
7) Make it bolder/darker by changing to one of:
- h-px bg-black/20  (subtle but stronger)
OR
- h-[2px] bg-black/15 (slightly thicker)

Use the same choice consistently across all headings.

PART D — VERIFY
8) On mobile:
- Open hamburger menu
- Confirm section headings are clearly bold
- Confirm underline is darker/thicker
- Confirm About Civilla section items show 3 different icons (Target / Users / Info)
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- Line ranges changed in Navbar.tsx and NavbarCream.tsx
- Confirm bold headings + bold lines + distinct About icons visible on mobile
