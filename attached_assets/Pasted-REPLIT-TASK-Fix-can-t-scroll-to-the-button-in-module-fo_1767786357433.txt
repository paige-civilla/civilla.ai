REPLIT TASK: Fix “can’t scroll to the button” in module forms (bottom padding + nested scroll traps)

Context
AppLayout is now min-h-[100dvh], good.
But testers still can’t scroll to reach the primary action button in some modules when zoomed or on smaller screens.

Goal
Ensure every module page/form has:
- no nested scroll traps
- enough bottom padding so the last button is always reachable
- only ONE vertical scroll container per page (AppLayout main) unless deliberate

Do ALL steps A–F.

A) Add a global “safe bottom” utility class
In client/src/index.css add:
.safe-bottom {
  padding-bottom: calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px) + 96px);
}
(This ensures the bottom of pages clears sticky UI, browser bars, and zoom quirks.)

B) Apply .safe-bottom to every module page main wrapper
In each module page (Timeline, Evidence, Documents, Communications, Deadlines, Exhibits, Trial Prep, Parenting Plan, Disclosures, Start Here, etc):
Find the outermost page content wrapper inside <AppLayout>.
Add safe-bottom to the wrapper that contains the full page content.
Example:
<section className="w-full ... safe-bottom">

C) Remove accidental nested overflow scrolling on pages
Search for these patterns in client/src/pages:
- overflow-y-auto
- overflow-auto
- h-screen / h-[100vh]
- max-h-[...]
If a page already scrolls via AppLayout’s <main overflow-y-auto>,
REMOVE page-level overflow-y-auto unless it’s a deliberate sub-pane (like EvidenceViewer modal).
Goal: the page should not have its own scroll unless it’s inside a modal/split-pane.

D) Ensure “Add/Save” buttons are not inside a clipped container
On pages where the primary action is at the bottom (Create Case, New Timeline Event, Add Evidence, Create Document, Add Deadline, etc):
- ensure the button container is inside the same main flow container with safe-bottom
- if it’s inside a Card/ScrollArea, move it OUTSIDE that ScrollArea

E) For modals/sheets: add bottom padding inside ScrollArea content
In EvidenceViewer modal + any Sheet/Dialog that contains a long form:
- add className="pb-24" to the scroll content area
- or apply safe-bottom inside the modal body if it’s a full-height sheet

F) Report back with exact locations
After implementing, report:
- files changed
- which pages had nested overflow removed
- which forms/buttons were moved out of ScrollArea / clipped containers
- confirm “zoom 150% + small height” can still reach action buttons
