Replit — add “Disclosures & Discovery” as a real module tile on the Case Dashboard and wire it to the existing page.

Goal:
Show a new module tile on the dashboard (and case workspace grid if it exists) for:
Label: “Disclosures & Discovery”
Route: /app/disclosures/:caseId   (use the same routing pattern as the other case modules)

Assumptions:
- The page already exists (you previously implemented it). If the page file or route does NOT exist, create it with the same layout shell as other modules and a placeholder ModuleIntro so the tile isn’t dead.

Steps:

1) Add/verify route
- In client/src/App.tsx (or wherever routes are defined), ensure there is a protected route:
  <Route path="/app/disclosures/:caseId" element={<AppDisclosures />} />
- If AppDisclosures component isn’t imported, import it.
- If AppDisclosures does not exist, create:
  client/src/pages/AppDisclosures.tsx
  using the same pattern as AppEvidence/AppDeadlines pages (AppLayout wrapper, caseId from params, ModuleIntro at top, placeholder content).

2) Add the module tile on the Dashboard
- In client/src/pages/AppDashboard.tsx:
  - Find the modules array/list that renders the module tiles.
  - Add a new entry near Deadlines / Documents (where it logically fits):
    key: "disclosures"
    label: "Disclosures & Discovery"
    href: `/app/disclosures/${caseId}`
    background: use the standard module tile styling already in place (the new scheme: tile bg #E4ECED, border #628286, icon stroke #628286).
    icon: pick a relevant lucide icon (e.g., FileSearch, ClipboardList, FolderSearch — your choice) and ensure the icon stroke matches #628286.

3) Add to the AppNavbar menu (if all modules are present there)
- In client/src/components/layout/AppNavbar.tsx:
  - Add “Disclosures & Discovery” to the dropdown/menu list so users can navigate to it.
  - Link to `/app/disclosures/${caseId}` like other modules.

4) Add to Case Workspace tiles (if you have a separate case workspace grid)
- In client/src/pages/AppCase.tsx (or wherever the case workspace module grid is):
  - Add the same tile entry so it matches the dashboard module list.
  - If you are gating modules by case flags, do NOT gate this one (always show it).

5) Visual consistency checks
- Ensure the tile uses:
  - background: #E4ECED
  - border/icon outline: #628286
  - hover highlight/overlay: #A2BEC2 (same behavior as other tiles)

6) Verify
- Run the app.
- Open a case dashboard:
  - Confirm the tile appears.
  - Clicking it navigates to /app/disclosures/:caseId successfully.
- Confirm nav menu includes it and it routes correctly.

Deliverable response:
- List the exact files edited
- Paste the added module object/JSX snippet for the dashboard modules array
- Confirm the final route path string used (must be /app/disclosures/:caseId)

Important:
Do not remove or rename existing modules. Only add this new tile + nav entry + route verification.
