REPLIT AGENT TASK: Mobile StepsSection Polish (Use Numeric Step Labels, Center The Number, Add Thin Dividers)

GOAL (MOBILE ONLY)
In client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx mobile layout (the md:hidden block):
1) Replace “Step One/Two/Three” with numeric step labels: “Step 1”, “Step 2”, “Step 3”
2) Display the NUMBER (1/2/3) as its own element and vertically CENTER it relative to the paragraph on the right (so it feels aligned in the middle of the text block).
3) Add a thin divider line between each step row (mobile only), not after the last row.

FILE TO EDIT
client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx

INSTRUCTIONS
1) Open client/src/components/StepsSection.tsx
2) In the MOBILE block (md:hidden), DO NOT change the desktop layout.
3) Update the STEPS data so labels are numeric:
- “Step One” -> “Step 1”
- “Step Two” -> “Step 2”
- “Step Three” -> “Step 3”

4) Change the mobile row layout to a 3-column grid:
- Column A: “Step” (small label)
- Column B: the NUMBER (large, bold) — THIS should be vertically centered with the paragraph
- Column C: the paragraph text

Use a structure like this (adapt to existing classNames, but keep the intent):

<div className="md:hidden">
  <div className="space-y-0">
    {STEPS.map((s, idx) => {
      const num = s.label.replace("Step ", ""); // expects "Step 1/2/3"
      return (
        <div key={s.label} className="py-8">
          <div className="grid grid-cols-[64px,40px,1fr] gap-4 items-center">
            <div className="text-sm font-semibold text-neutral-900">Step</div>

            <div className="text-3xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 text-center leading-none">
              {num}
            </div>

            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
              {s.body}
            </p>
          </div>

          {idx !== STEPS.length - 1 && (
            <div className="mt-8 w-full border-b border-black/10" />
          )}
        </div>
      );
    })}
  </div>
</div>

IMPORTANT:
- items-center is required on the row grid so the number centers vertically against the paragraph.
- The divider should be thin and subtle (border-black/10 or border-neutral/200).
- Do not add a divider after the last item.

5) Keep the disclaimer line unchanged and below the mobile layout.

VERIFY
- Mobile: left shows “Step” and a centered number (1/2/3) aligned with the paragraph block
- Thin divider lines appear between steps
- Desktop view remains unchanged
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- Exact line ranges changed
- Confirm tested mobile + desktop preview
