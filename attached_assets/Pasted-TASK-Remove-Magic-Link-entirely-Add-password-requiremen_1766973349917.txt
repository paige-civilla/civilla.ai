TASK: Remove Magic Link entirely + Add password requirement live-check + Fix navbar dropdown visibility

AUTONOMY: LOW

DO NOT:
- Redesign pages
- Change global typography/colors/tokens
- Add new features beyond what is requested
- Change marketing page content

PART 1 — REMOVE MAGIC LINK (FRONTEND + BACKEND)
GOAL:
Completely remove “magic link” login from the product so it cannot be requested or used.

Frontend:
1) Login page:
   - Remove the “Magic link” button/section entirely.
   - Remove any UI toggle/switch that chooses between “Password” vs “Magic link” modes.
   - Login page should be ONLY email + password + social buttons (Google/Apple) + submit.

2) Register page:
   - Registration should be ONLY email + password + confirm password + social buttons (Google/Apple) + submit.
   - Do not offer magic link anywhere.

Backend:
3) Remove magic link endpoints and logic:
   - Remove /api/auth/magic-link/request (or any magic link request route)
   - Remove /api/auth/magic-link/callback (or any magic link consume route)
   - Remove auth_magic_links table if it exists and is only used for magic links
   - Remove server/mail usage related to magic link (if mail remains for other reasons, keep fail-soft but unused is fine)
   - Ensure no references remain in routes.ts, auth.ts, storage.ts, schema.ts, oauth.ts.

Validation:
- Grep for “magic” / “magic-link” / “auth_magic_links” and confirm nothing remains except maybe old migrations (if any).
- Login/register flows must still work (password + social login).

PART 2 — PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS + LIVE INDICATOR (REGISTER PAGE)
GOAL:
On /register, show live password requirements that update red/green as the user types.

Requirements (exact):
- At least 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 number
- At least 1 special character

Implementation:
1) In Register page component:
   - Add computed booleans for each rule from password string.
   - Display a small list under the password field:
     - “8+ characters”
     - “1 uppercase letter”
     - “1 number”
     - “1 special character”
   - Each item should visually show met/unmet:
     - Unmet: text-neutral-darkest/60 (or destructive/70) + small indicator dot/icon
     - Met: text-bush (or success token if exists) + indicator
   - Do NOT add new brand colors; use existing tokens/classes already used in the app.
   - Keep layout consistent (same spacing scale).
2) Form validation:
   - Disable submit until all requirements are met AND confirm password matches.
   - If user tries to submit anyway, show a single inline error message (existing error pattern).

PART 3 — NAVBAR DROPDOWN VISIBILITY FIX (HOVER/CLICK)
SYMPTOM:
Hover/click changes trigger styling but menu is not visible.

GOAL:
Dropdown must render visibly above content on desktop + mobile.

Implementation requirements:
1) Ensure dropdown container is actually rendered when open:
   - It must be positioned with absolute positioning relative to a parent wrapper that has `relative`.
   - Use: `absolute top-full right-0 mt-2`
2) Ensure it is not hidden:
   - Add `z-50` (or higher) to dropdown.
   - Ensure any parent wrappers do NOT have `overflow-hidden` that clips the menu. If a parent has overflow hidden, move the dropdown portal higher in DOM or remove overflow hidden only from the minimal wrapper.
3) Ensure it has a visible surface:
   - Add background: use your existing tokens (bg-cream for cream navbar dropdown, bg-neutral-darkest or bg-bush for dark navbar dropdown—match what Figma expects for that navbar style).
   - Add border: border-neutral-darkest/10 (or similar existing border token).
   - Add shadow: shadow-lg (or existing shadow class).
   - Add rounded corners consistent with existing (rounded-xl or the navbar’s existing radius).
4) Ensure hover behavior isn’t instantly closing:
   - The hover open/close logic must be attached to a wrapper that includes BOTH trigger and menu.
   - Example pattern:
     <div className="relative" onMouseEnter={...} onMouseLeave={...}>
       Trigger
       {open && <div className="absolute ...">Menu</div>}
     </div>
5) Mobile:
   - Clicking should toggle open.
   - Hover should not be required.
