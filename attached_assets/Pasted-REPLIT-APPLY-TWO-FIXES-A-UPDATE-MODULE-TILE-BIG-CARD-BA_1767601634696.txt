REPLIT: APPLY TWO FIXES

A) UPDATE MODULE TILE / BIG CARD BACKGROUND COLOR TO #C3D5D7

1) Search the frontend for the old module background color usages:
   - Search: "#E4ECED"
   - Search: "bg-[#E4ECED]"
   - Search: "#A2BEC2" (only where it is used as the tile/card background, not highlights)

2) Replace ONLY the module tile / large card backgrounds (Dashboard tiles, Start Here accordion cards, “Create your first case” empty-state card background, module landing cards) from:
   - #E4ECED  ->  #C3D5D7

3) Do NOT change:
   - Navbar/footer background token (#314143 or whatever you set for nav)
   - Highlight color (#A2BEC2) that appears on hover/selected states
   - Borders/outlines unless explicitly tied to the old module BG

4) If the app uses CSS tokens, update the “app theme” token that drives module tiles/cards:
   - In client/src/index.css (or wherever theme tokens live), under the authenticated app theme scope (e.g. .theme-app or .app-shell):
     - Set the module/card surface variable used by tiles to #C3D5D7.
     - Example: if tiles use --muted for the card background, set:
       --muted: #C3D5D7;
     - If tiles use a dedicated variable (preferred), set:
       --module-surface: #C3D5D7;
     - Then ensure the module tile component uses that token (bg-muted or bg-[hsl(var(--module-surface))]).

5) Verify visually:
   - Dashboard tiles background is #C3D5D7
   - Start Here “accordion cards” background is #C3D5D7
   - “Create your first case” empty-state card background is #C3D5D7


B) FIX “CREATE YOUR FIRST CASE” BUTTON NOT WORKING

Goal: If the user has 0 cases, clicking “Create Your Case” must always open the create-case form/dialog and allow creation, regardless of upgrade gating.

1) Open: client/src/pages/AppCases.tsx

2) Find the “Create your first case” empty-state section and the button labeled “Create Your Case”.

3) Ensure the button is NOT disabled and has a working handler.
   - If it should open a dialog:
     - Confirm there is state like: const [isCreateDialogOpen, setIsCreateDialogOpen] = useState(false);
     - Confirm the button has: onClick={() => setIsCreateDialogOpen(true)}
     - Confirm the <Dialog open={isCreateDialogOpen} onOpenChange={setIsCreateDialogOpen}> is present.
   - If it should navigate:
     - Confirm it has: onClick={() => setLocation("/app/cases?new=1")} (or your chosen route)
     - Then confirm AppCases reads the query param and auto-opens the create form.

4) Fix the common regression: “upgrade gating” blocks creation even when 0 cases.
   - Locate the logic that blocks creation when casesAllowed is exceeded (or “Upgrade to add another case”).
   - Add an explicit override:
     - If cases.length === 0, always allow creating the first case.
   - In other words:
     - show Upgrade CTA only when cases.length >= casesAllowed (and casesAllowed is not unlimited)
     - but never block the first case creation.

5) Confirm the create mutation actually fires and the list refreshes:
   - After create success:
     - invalidate the cases query (react-query invalidateQueries for the cases list)
     - navigate to the new case dashboard (or select it as active)
   - Ensure no early-return is preventing the handler from running.

6) Add a quick console-safe debug (remove after verifying):
   - In the Create Your Case onClick handler, temporarily add:
     console.log("Create Your Case clicked");
   - Verify it appears when clicking.
   - Then remove the log.

DELIVERABLES BACK TO ME:
- Which files you changed for the #C3D5D7 swap (list them)
- What the exact cause of the Create Your Case button failure was (disabled state? missing handler? upgrade gating? dialog not mounted? query param not handled?)
- Confirm after fix: brand-new user with 0 cases can create a case successfully and is taken into that case.
