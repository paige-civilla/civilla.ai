TASK: Reframe Child Support module so it is not a “calculator promise”, and add an optional Lexi-driven educational estimate flow (only when confident). Be detailed in your summary of edits.

A) Rename module labels (no route changes)
1) In client/src/lib/modules.ts:
- Change label from "Child Support Estimator" to "Child Support (Worksheet Helper)"
- Change description to "Find your state's official child support worksheet/calculator and get an educational estimate."

2) Anywhere in UI where the header says "Child Support Estimator", change to "Child Support (Worksheet Helper)" (likely client/src/pages/AppChildSupport.tsx and nav/menu labels).

B) Update AppChildSupport.tsx UI to support TWO actions:
1) Primary button (existing research):
- Keep the existing research button but rename it to:
  "Find My State’s Official Worksheet"
- Under the button, add helper text:
  "We’ll save this research to this case so you can come back later."

2) Add a SECONDARY action:
- Add a button labeled:
  "Get an Educational Estimate"
- When clicked, open a modal (or inline step) that collects the minimum inputs needed:
  - gross monthly income Parent A
  - gross monthly income Parent B
  - number of children
  - (optional) overnights/parenting time
  - (optional) monthly childcare
  - (optional) monthly health insurance for child(ren)
Include "I don’t know yet" per field.

C) Add a new backend endpoint to request Lexi to compute an estimate *from official sources*
1) In server/routes.ts add:
POST /api/cases/:caseId/child-support/estimate
Body: { state: string, inputs: { parentAIncome?: number, parentBIncome?: number, children?: number, overnights?: number, childcare?: number, healthInsurance?: number } }

Behavior:
- requireAuth and verify case ownership
- Use Lexi in RESEARCH mode to:
  (1) fetch/confirm the official guideline/calculator name and link(s) for the state
  (2) attempt to compute an EDUCATIONAL estimate from the provided inputs ONLY IF the guideline can be confidently applied
  (3) If not confident, return a safe response:
      "This state’s calculation is too complex to compute reliably without the official calculator. Here is the official calculator/worksheet link and exactly how to enter your inputs."
- Response shape: { ok: true, content: string, didCompute: boolean }
- Content must include:
  - a short disclaimer (single paragraph)
  - a “Sources” section with official links
  - if didCompute=true: show the math steps and what assumptions were used

D) Wire the frontend to this estimate endpoint
1) In AppChildSupport.tsx:
- When user clicks “Get an Educational Estimate” and submits inputs, call:
  POST /api/cases/:caseId/child-support/estimate
- Render the returned content in the same results area as research, but with a heading:
  "Educational Estimate" or "Worksheet Guidance" depending on didCompute

E) Make it clear but not scary
- Remove any wording that implies court-accurate results.
- Keep one banner at top: "Educational tool — not court-accurate; verify with official calculator/worksheet."

F) Output requirements
- After implementing, provide a detailed summary:
  - files changed
  - endpoints added
  - what inputs the modal collects
  - how you decide didCompute true vs false
  - how to test in the UI
