REPLIT TASK: Fix Lexi reliability + header/arrow UX + remove case requirement + shorten Child Support menu label

Goal
1) Lexi must work for ANY logged-in user (no caseId required).
2) “Start conversation” MUST always create a thread and messages MUST send.
3) Lexi header must show: chevron + “Lexi” + subtitle “Your AI assistant”, with correct chevron direction for open/closed.
4) Suggested question chips must appear and must auto-send (and auto-create a thread if none exists).
5) Fix the main menu label so “Child Support Worksheet Helper” does not overlap Trial Prep (shorten label + prevent wrap/overlap).

Acceptance Tests
A) Logged in, no case selected / no cases at all:
- Open Lexi panel
- Click “Start conversation”
- A thread is created (200 response) and input becomes enabled
- Send message; assistant responds

B) Suggested questions:
- With no thread, click any suggested question chip
- It creates a thread and sends the message (no extra clicks)
- A user message appears + assistant response appears

C) Header UI:
- When panel is closed: a right-edge tab shows “▸ Lexi” (or “▸ Lexi” style) and is clickable
- When panel is open: header shows “▾ Lexi” (or “▾ Lexi”) and subtitle “Your AI assistant”
- Chevron direction flips correctly on toggle
- Tab/label is visually attached to the panel edge (no floating in middle)

D) Menu label:
- AppNavbar menu shows “Child Support” (or “Child Support Helper”) and does not overlap other items
- Long labels do not wrap into other items; they truncate gracefully with ellipsis

Implementation (do all)

PART 1: Backend – make Lexi threads/messages NOT case-scoped

1) server/routes.ts
- Ensure these endpoints exist and are requireAuth protected:
  POST /api/lexi/threads
  GET  /api/lexi/threads
  GET  /api/lexi/threads/:threadId/messages
  POST /api/lexi/threads/:threadId/messages

- For POST /api/lexi/threads:
  - Accept body: { title?: string, caseId?: string | null }
  - caseId must be OPTIONAL and nullable
  - Create a “general” thread if caseId missing:
    - store caseId as NULL
    - store moduleKey as NULL unless provided
  - If DB insert fails, return JSON with a code:
    { error: "Failed to create thread", code: "CREATE_THREAD_FAILED" }

- For POST /api/lexi/threads/:threadId/messages:
  - Do NOT require caseId
  - Only require: user owns threadId
  - If thread caseId is null, still allow chat.

2) server/storage.ts
- Confirm Lexi thread/message storage supports NULL caseId threads:
  - createLexiThread(userId, { caseId?: string | null, title?: string })
  - listLexiThreads(userId) should return both case threads and general threads
  - ownership enforcement must remain strict (userId filter)

3) server/db.ts
- You already added ensureLexiThreadsColumns(). Add/confirm:
  - lexi_threads.case_id column is nullable
  - no constraint that requires case_id
  - migration is idempotent

PART 2: Frontend – thread auto-create + sending never blocked

1) client/src/components/lexi/LexiPanel.tsx
- Remove any logic that blocks Lexi when there is no caseId.
  - NO “Open a case to start chat” gating.
  - Lexi should run as long as user is authenticated.

- Make Start Conversation always create a thread:
  - If no activeThreadId:
    - call POST /api/lexi/threads with { title: "General", caseId: null }
    - set activeThreadId from response
    - then allow sending

- Make sending robust:
  - sendMessage(text):
    - if (!activeThreadId) await createThread()
    - then POST message to /api/lexi/threads/:threadId/messages
  - Show a clear inline error if thread creation fails:
    “Could not start Lexi chat. Please try again.”

- Suggested question chips:
  - Must render even when no thread exists
  - On click:
    - await ensureThread()
    - send message immediately
  - If user types anything (input length > 0), the suggested chips area collapses/hides.

2) Fix the header and toggle label:
- Replace the current </> tab with a Lexi-labeled toggle:
  - Closed state tab: “▸ Lexi”
  - Open state header left: “▾ Lexi”
- Subtitle under Lexi:
  - “Your AI assistant”
- Keep the close “X” on the right.

3) Fix positioning so the tab is attached to the panel edge:
- The “closed tab” should be position: fixed; right: 0; vertically centered
- The open panel should be position: fixed; right margin consistent with navbar height:
  - top should be (navbarHeight + spacing), not 0
- Use a single shared PANEL_WIDTH constant for:
  - panel width
  - tab left offset math (if any)
  - avoid mismatched clamp() values

4) Replace the yellow disclaimer bar color:
- Change yellow/amber bar to theme green or theme accent blue:
  - use bg-[hsl(var(--accent))] or a consistent brand token
  - ensure text contrast is readable

PART 3: Menu label for Child Support (stop overlap)

1) client/src/lib/modules.ts (or wherever module labels live)
- Change:
  label: "Child Support Worksheet Helper"
  to:
  label: "Child Support"
  (or "Child Support Helper" if you prefer)

2) client/src/components/layout/AppNavbar.tsx
- Ensure menu item text does not overlap:
  - Add:
    className="truncate"
    and/or
    "max-w-[...]" to the label container
  - Ensure each menu item is flex with:
    icon fixed width + text flex-1 truncate
  - On hover highlight, keep text readable (white if highlight is dark)

PART 4: Report back with verification
After changes, respond with:
- Files changed
- Confirm Lexi works without caseId
- Confirm Start Conversation creates a thread + messages send
- Confirm chevron + Lexi label works open/closed and is attached to the edge
- Confirm Child Support label no longer overlaps Trial Prep
- Include any remaining logs/errors if something still fails

Important Notes
- Do NOT remove requireAuth from Lexi endpoints.
- Do NOT log secrets.
- Keep per-user ownership enforcement on all Lexi reads/writes.
