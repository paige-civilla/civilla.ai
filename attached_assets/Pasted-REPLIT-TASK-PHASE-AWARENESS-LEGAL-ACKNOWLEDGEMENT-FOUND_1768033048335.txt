REPLIT TASK — PHASE AWARENESS + LEGAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (FOUNDATIONAL UX)

GOAL:
Make Civilla behave like the Modification of Custody workflow by clearly guiding users through phases and enforcing legal disclaimers without overwhelming the dashboard or creating new modules.

WHAT TO IMPLEMENT:

1. PHASE AWARENESS UX (GLOBAL)
- Add a small, non-intrusive banner at the top of main app pages that indicates the current phase:
  • Phase 1: Evidence & Timeline
  • Phase 2: Patterns & Claims
  • Phase 3: Court-Formatted Documents
- The banner should automatically change based on the page/module the user is on.
- This is informational only (no blocking).

2. LEGAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT GATE (PHASE-BASED)
- Before a user enters Phase 3 (Document Drafting):
  • Show a one-time acknowledgement modal stating:
    “Civilla is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice. Documents are generated from user-provided information and must be reviewed before filing.”
  • Require explicit user agreement before continuing.
  • Store acknowledgement so it does NOT repeat every time.

3. JUMP-AHEAD WARNING (NOT A BLOCK)
- If a user attempts to access Phase 3 without sufficient preparation (evidence, claims, citations):
  • Allow access
  • Show a warning banner:
    “You can continue, but your draft may be incomplete due to missing evidence or citations.”

4. NAVIGATION PLACEMENT
- Do NOT create a new module.
- Phase awareness and acknowledgements should live in:
  • App layout
  • Document creator flow
  • Existing navigation patterns only

5. PRIVACY & UPL COMPLIANCE
- Ensure this system:
  • Does NOT provide legal advice
  • Does NOT suggest what to file
  • Only explains structure, readiness, and limitations
- Language must be neutral, court-appropriate, and consistent with existing compliance text.

DELIVERABLE:
- Phase banner visible across the app
- One-time legal acknowledgement before drafting
- Non-blocking warnings for early access
- No new dashboard modules added

DO NOT:
- Add legal strategy
- Add filing instructions
- Add admin visibility into user content
