TASK: Add “show/hide password” eye toggle on Login + Create Account

AUTONOMY: LOW
GOAL:
On the Login page and the Create Account (Register) page, add a small eye icon button inside each password input (right side) that toggles between masked and visible text.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change layout/spacing/colors beyond what’s necessary to place the icon inside the input.
- Keep existing tokens/classes (bush/cream/etc).
- Use wouter routing as-is; do not touch routes.
- Must be accessible: aria-label must update, and button must be keyboard focusable.
- Must work on mobile.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1) Create a small reusable component:
   File: client/src/components/ui/PasswordField.tsx (NEW)
   - Props: label, id, name, value, onChange, placeholder?, autoComplete?, required?, error?
   - Internally manage `show` boolean with useState(false)
   - Render label + input wrapper (relative)
   - Input type is show ? "text" : "password"
   - Add a button positioned absolute right-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2
   - Button toggles show and uses an eye/eye-off icon (lucide-react preferred). If lucide not installed, use simple text “Show/Hide”.

   Example positioning classes (match existing input classes):
   - wrapper: "relative"
   - input: keep the exact existing input className you already use, just add "pr-10" so text doesn’t overlap the icon
   - button: "absolute right-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 text-neutral-darkest/60 hover:text-neutral-darkest focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-bush/30 rounded"

   Accessibility:
   - button type="button"
   - aria-label={show ? "Hide password" : "Show password"}
   - aria-pressed={show}

2) Update Login page to use it:
   File: client/src/pages/Login.tsx
   - Replace the password <input> with <PasswordField ... />
   - Preserve validation, error messaging, and submit logic exactly as-is.
   - If there is a “confirm password” field here (unlikely), also use PasswordField.

3) Update Register page to use it:
   File: client/src/pages/Register.tsx
   - Replace password input with PasswordField
   - Replace confirm password input with PasswordField
   - Preserve password requirements UI (red/green checklist) exactly as-is, just ensure it still reads the same password state.

VALIDATION:
- Login: typing password works, eye toggles masking on/off, submit unchanged.
- Register: password + confirm password both toggle independently, checklist still updates.
- No console errors.
- Mobile: icon doesn’t overlap text, no overflow.

DELIVERABLE:
- Provide file list + line ranges changed.
- Confirm both pages have the eye toggle working.
