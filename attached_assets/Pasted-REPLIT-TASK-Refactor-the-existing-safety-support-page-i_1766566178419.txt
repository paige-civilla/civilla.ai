REPLIT TASK: Refactor the existing **/safety-support** page into a cleaner single page called **“Safety, Support & Resources”**.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- ONLY edit the Safety & Support page (the page routed at `/safety-support`) and any tiny shared components you *must* add to support it (e.g., a small local accordion helper). Do NOT edit Home, How Civilla Works, Plans/Pricing, Footer, Green Navbar, Cream Navbar, or any other pages/components.
- Keep ALL the same images that are currently on the Safety & Support page. Do not remove or replace them. You may move them into new sections/layouts.
- Remove “button-happy” UI. This page should have at most ONE primary CTA button (“Email support” / “Contact support”). Everything else should be headings, text, lists, and accordions.

GOAL
The page should read like a single, clear resource hub:
1) Safety tools inside civilla
2) Quick Exit explanation (accurate)
3) Privacy/discretion guidance (calm)
4) Emotional safety (supportive)
5) Emergency resources (prominent + clear)

STEP 1 — FIND THE FILE
- Locate the route `/safety-support` in the router (likely `client/src/App.tsx` or `client/src/router.tsx`).
- Open the page component used for this route (likely something like `client/src/pages/SafetySupport.tsx` or similar). ALL edits happen here.

STEP 2 — RENAME THE PAGE TITLE + HERO (NO BUTTONS)
Replace the current hero with:
- H1: “Safety, Support & Resources”
- Subhead: “Tools and guidance designed to help you stay safe, supported, and in control—online and offline.”
- Remove the “Learn” and “Resources” buttons from the hero entirely.
- Keep styling consistent with the site’s existing hero styles (same spacing, font scale, and container width used elsewhere).

STEP 3 — QUICK EXIT SECTION (KEEP YOUR QUICK EXIT IMAGE(S); FIX UNSAFE CLAIMS)
Create a section titled:
- “Leave in a click”
Body copy must NOT claim civilla clears browsing history or guarantees no record remains.
Use accurate copy like:
- “Use Quick Exit in the top bar to immediately leave civilla and open a neutral website. For extra privacy, consider using private browsing and clearing your history after use.”
Keep and display the existing “Quick exit” imagery already present on the page.

STEP 4 — DESIGNED FOR DISCRETION (KEEP YOUR DISCRETION IMAGE(S); REMOVE BUTTONS)
Create a section titled:
- “Designed for discretion”
Short body:
- “civilla is built to feel calm and unobtrusive—no flashing alerts, no surprise pop-ups, and no attention-grabbing visuals.”
Keep the existing discretion-related image(s) where they already exist in the page (just reposition into this section).
Remove any “Help” / “Learn more” buttons attached to these cards/images.

STEP 5 — SAFETY TOOLS INSIDE CIVILLA (TURN BUTTON-CARDS INTO A CLEAN CHECKLIST)
Replace the current “Additional safety tools” button-cards with a clean checklist/grid (NO buttons):
- ✅ Neutral username option — Use a non-identifying account name
- ✅ Customized notifications — Control when and how civilla contacts you
- ✅ Private browsing tips — Guidance for safer browsing habits
If there is currently a “Help” link inside each card, remove it.
If you want expandable details, use `<details><summary>…</summary>…</details>` (native HTML) instead of buttons.

STEP 6 — EMOTIONAL SAFETY (KEEP NATURE IMAGE; CLEAN LAYOUT)
Create a section titled:
- “Your emotional safety matters”
Body:
- “Family court can feel overwhelming or frightening. civilla is here to help you feel informed, steady, and organized—without pressure or judgment.”
Keep the existing nature image.
Below it, format the “You are heard / You are in control / You are supported” content as:
- Desktop: 3 columns
- Mobile: stacked cards/rows
No buttons.

STEP 7 — EMERGENCY SECTION (KEEP THE DARK GREEN EMERGENCY IMAGE; MAKE IT CLEAR)
Near the bottom, include the existing emergency block/image with the title:
- “Important: civilla is not an emergency service”
Keep the hotline list, but remove any extra CTA buttons except ONE optional “Email support” button for non-emergency help.

STEP 8 — REMOVE REDUNDANT CONTACT BOXES / DUPLICATE “CONTACT US”
If the page currently repeats “Contact us” in multiple places:
- Consolidate to ONE support CTA near the bottom:
  - Button text: “Email support”
  - `href="mailto:support@civilla.ai"` (or whatever support email is already used in the project—reuse the existing one if present)

STEP 9 — VISUAL / UX REQUIREMENTS
- Reduce visual noise: no extra buttons on cards, no repeated “Help >” links.
- Consistent spacing: use the same section padding and max-width container used on other pages.
- Each section should have a clear title and 1–3 short paragraphs max.
- Keep the same overall brand look (colors, rounded corners, borders) already used in the app.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
- /safety-support renders with the new title “Safety, Support & Resources”.
- All existing images from the current Safety & Support page still appear somewhere on the page.
- “Learn” and “Resources” hero buttons are gone.
- No text claims civilla clears browser history.
- Page has at most one primary CTA button (“Email support”).
- The page feels like one unified hub (not multiple competing pages).

Now implement these changes directly in the `/safety-support` page component.
