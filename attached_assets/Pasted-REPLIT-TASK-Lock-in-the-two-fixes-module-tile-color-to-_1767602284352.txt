REPLIT TASK: Lock in the two fixes (module tile color to #C3D5D7 + Create First Case button) and verify no remaining hardcoded tile colors.

A) VERIFY + NORMALIZE MODULE TILE COLOR
1) Repo-wide search:
- Search for any remaining hardcoded tile backgrounds:
  - bg-[#E4ECED]
  - bg-[#A2BEC2]
  - bg-[#EFF3F4]
  - bg-muted (when used for tiles)
2) Replace tile backgrounds to use the CSS token instead of hex:
- Use a single class for module tiles everywhere, e.g.:
  - bg-[hsl(var(--module-tile))]
  - hover:bg-[hsl(var(--module-tile-hover))]
  - border-[hsl(var(--border))]
This ensures switching the color in index.css updates all tiles consistently.

3) Confirm the module tile background is visually #C3D5D7 on:
- Dashboard tiles
- Case workspace tiles
- Start Here page cards (if they use tile styling)
- Any “empty state” cards that are intended to match tiles

B) FIX + VERIFY “CREATE YOUR FIRST CASE” FLOW
1) In client/src/pages/AppCases.tsx ensure:
- When noCases && !showForm: show the empty-state welcome card with the Create Your Case button.
- When noCases && showForm: render the FULL create-case form inline (not hidden behind !noCases).
- When user submits successfully: navigate to the newly created case dashboard route.

2) Confirm correct route:
- Check client/src/App.tsx for the actual dashboard route pattern.
- If it is /app/dashboard/:caseId then navigate there.
- If it is different, update navigation to match the real route.

3) Acceptance tests:
- Brand-new user (0 cases):
  - sees empty state
  - clicks Create Your Case
  - form appears
  - submit creates case
  - user is redirected to the correct case dashboard page
- Existing user (>=1 case):
  - cases list shows
  - Create new case section still works
  - redirect after creation works

C) OUTPUT A DETAILED SUMMARY
After completing, report:
- Every file changed
- Every location where a hardcoded tile color was replaced
- The exact route you redirect to after creation
- A note confirming the empty state now shows the form when showForm is true
