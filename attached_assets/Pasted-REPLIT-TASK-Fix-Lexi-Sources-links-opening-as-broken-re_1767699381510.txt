REPLIT TASK: Fix Lexi “Sources” links opening as broken relative paths

Problem
Clicking Lexi source links does NOT open the intended webpage.
Instead it navigates to a base site and then a “not found” state page.
This happens when Lexi outputs sources without an absolute URL scheme
(e.g., "www.example.com/..." or "example.com/..." or "/courts/forms").

Goal
All Lexi links must become absolute, external URLs (https://...) and open in a new tab.
No internal router navigation.
No relative-path links.

A) Force Lexi to output ABSOLUTE URLs
File: server/routes.ts (Lexi chat system prompt)

Add this rule to the prompt:

"SOURCES FORMAT:
- Every source MUST be a full absolute URL starting with https://
- Do not output 'www.' links without https://
- Do not output bare domains (example.com) without https://
- Do not output relative paths (/forms, courts.idaho.gov/forms, etc.)
- If you can't find a working official URL, say: 'No official URL found' and provide what to search on the official site."

B) Normalize hrefs in Lexi UI so even imperfect links work
File: client/src/components/lexi/LexiPanel.tsx

1) Add this helper near the top of the file:

function normalizeHref(href?: string | null) {
  if (!href) return null;
  const raw = href.trim();

  // Already absolute http(s)
  if (/^https?:\/\//i.test(raw)) return raw;

  // Starts with www.
  if (/^www\./i.test(raw)) return `https://${raw}`;

  // Bare domain like idaho.gov/forms
  // If it contains a dot and no spaces, treat as domain/path
  if (/^[^\s]+\.[^\s]+$/i.test(raw)) return `https://${raw}`;

  // Prevent accidental relative navigation
  // Anything else is considered unsafe/unusable as a link
  return null;
}

2) In your ReactMarkdown components override (or add one),
force external link behavior using normalizeHref:

components={{
  a: ({ href, children, ...props }) => {
    const normalized = normalizeHref(href);

    // If not a usable external link, render as plain text (NOT a broken link)
    if (!normalized) {
      return <span className="underline decoration-dotted">{children}</span>;
    }

    return (
      <a
        href={normalized}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer noopener"
        className="underline break-words"
        {...props}
      >
        {children}
      </a>
    );
  },
}}

Important:
- Do NOT use wouter Link for Lexi content.
- Do NOT intercept clicks for external links.

C) Stop internal router interception if present
Search for handlers inside Lexi message container that do preventDefault + setLocation.
Repo search:
rg -n "preventDefault|setLocation\\(|navigate\\(" client/src/components/lexi

If found, change the logic so it ONLY intercepts internal app links that start with "/app".
Everything else must be allowed to open normally.

D) Quick test
Ask Lexi:
"List the official Idaho Courts family law forms page and Idaho Legislature site. Include Sources as full URLs."

Expected:
- Links begin with https://
- Clicking opens correct external pages (new tab)
- No “base site” + “not found” behavior
- If Lexi outputs "www..." it still opens correctly because UI normalizes it

Report back
- Files changed
- Confirm at least 2 source links open correctly
