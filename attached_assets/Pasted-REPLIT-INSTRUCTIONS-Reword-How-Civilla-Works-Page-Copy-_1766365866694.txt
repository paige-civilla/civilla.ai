REPLIT INSTRUCTIONS — Reword “How Civilla Works” Page Copy (UPL-SAFE + Rebuild-Plan Tone)

RULES FOR THIS EDIT:
- DO NOT touch Navbar.tsx, NavbarCream.tsx, or Footer.tsx.
- Keep ALL brand mentions using <BrandMark /> where possible (so civilla / civilla.ai stays styled consistently).
- Keep language EDUCATIONAL + ORGANIZATIONAL only (no “tell you what to file,” no outcome promises).

FILE TO EDIT:
client/src/pages/HowCivillaWorks.tsx


1) HERO (TOP OF PAGE)
Find the H1 + subhead in the first hero and replace with:

H1:
“How <BrandMark /> Works”

Subhead (add period):
“A calm, step-by-step overview of what <BrandMark /> can help you understand and organize — without legal advice.”

(If you want “civilla.ai” specifically here, use: <BrandMark text="civilla.ai" />)


2) SECTION TITLE UNDER HERO
Find:
“Your case, step by step”
Replace with Title Case:
“Your Case, Step By Step”

Find the sentence under it (“See how family law cases typically move…”)
Replace with:
“See the stages many family-law cases often move through — and what people typically prepare along the way.”


3) STEP CARDS (THE BOXES)
For each step card, replace the title + supporting text with the following:

STEP ONE
Title:
“Understand Your Case Type And Timeline”
Supporting text:
“Choose your state and case type to view plain-language education and common stages people often see.”

STEP TWO
Title:
“Gather And Organize Your Information”
Supporting text:
“Add documents, messages, and key events. <BrandMark /> organizes what you provide into a clear, reviewable timeline.”

STEP THREE
Title:
“Learn What’s Typical (Not What To Do)”
Supporting text:
“Review statutes, court rules, and educational resources. <BrandMark /> does not tell you what to file, when to file, or what will happen.”

STEP FOUR
Title:
“Prepare With Clarity”
Supporting text:
“Use summaries, checklists, and organized notes to stay grounded, ask better questions, and bring your materials to your attorney or court.”

(Keep any images as-is. Keep buttons/“Explore >” removed.)


4) “WHAT YOU GET INSIDE” LIST (THE BIG STACKED BOX LIST)
Replace the list labels with consistent Title Case + “Your” framing:

- “Your Case Journey”
- “Evidence Map”
- “Research Guide”
- “Document Prep”
- “Timeline View”
- “Safety Tools”

If any of these are plain strings, just replace them.
If any include the word “civilla”, convert to <BrandMark />.


5) GREEN “CLARITY” SECTION (NO OUTCOME PROMISES)
Replace the headings/body copy in that green section with this safer tone:

Section Heading:
“What Changes When You Understand The Process”

Body:
“When the steps feel clearer, the overwhelm can ease. <BrandMark /> is built to help you learn what’s typical, track what matters, and stay organized.”

Then each mini-heading + line can be updated to:

Mini 1:
“The Stress Of Not Knowing What Comes Next”
“You move from guessing to informed preparation — one step at a time.”

Mini 2:
“What Your Options Actually Are”
“Education helps you evaluate choices with more context — without advice or promises.”

Mini 3:
“Your Sense Of Agency In Your Own Case”
“You can feel more steady when your information is organized and your questions are clearer.”


6) ANY TESTIMONIAL / QUOTE ON THIS PAGE
If there’s a quote that currently implies results, replace with:

“<BrandMark /> helped me feel less overwhelmed by what was happening — because I could finally see everything in one place.”

(Keep attribution generic and non-identifying.)


7) FINAL PASS
- Add periods to any full-sentence subheads that currently have none.
- Make sure “Works” is capitalized wherever it appears as a heading.
- Make sure every “civilla / civilla.ai / www.civilla.ai” uses <BrandMark ... /> (or matches the brand styling rule).
