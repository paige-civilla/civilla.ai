REPLIT TASK 2: Form Pack Finder (Official Link-outs + Save-to-Case)

GOAL
Add a “Find My Court Forms / Packets” feature that:
- Lets users pick State + County (optional) + case type
- Returns ONLY official sources (preferred .gov / .us / court domains)
- Saves selected links to the user’s case as “resources” (no scraping user data)

BACKEND
A) Add table:
case_resources
- id, user_id, case_id
- title, resource_type ("forms" | "calculator" | "instructions" | "filing" | "court")
- url (absolute https)
- jurisdiction_state, jurisdiction_county (nullable)
- tags JSONB (optional)
- created_at

B) Add endpoints:
GET /api/cases/:caseId/resources
POST /api/cases/:caseId/resources  { title, url, resourceType, tags? }
DELETE /api/resources/:resourceId

C) Add endpoint:
POST /api/cases/:caseId/form-packs/search
Body: { state, county?, caseType? }
Returns:
{
  ok: true,
  results: [
    { title, url, sourceLabel, jurisdiction: {state, county?}, confidence: "high"|"medium" }
  ],
  policy: { officialOnly: true }
}

D) How search works (privacy-safe):
- Use Lexi “Research mode” but restrict results:
  - Must be https
  - Must be official domains: courts, state judiciary, county clerk, .gov, .us
  - If not official, drop it.
- Always return 5–10 results max.
- Store the returned sources_json into case_rule_terms (module_key="form-packs") for caching by state/county.

FRONTEND
E) Add new module on sidebar under “Start Here” or “Extras”:
- “Court Forms & Packets”
- UI:
  - State dropdown (prefill from case)
  - County input (optional)
  - Case type dropdown (custody/divorce/support/protection order/etc)
  - Button: “Find Official Forms”
  - Results list with “Save to Case” button for each
  - “Saved Resources” section (editable title, delete)

COMPLIANCE
F) Copy/Disclaimers:
- “These are official links. Civilla doesn’t provide legal advice.”
- “Forms vary by county; verify on your court’s site.”

DONE WHEN
- Users can find official form packets and save them to their case
- No non-official domains appear in results
- Saved links show inside case resources list
