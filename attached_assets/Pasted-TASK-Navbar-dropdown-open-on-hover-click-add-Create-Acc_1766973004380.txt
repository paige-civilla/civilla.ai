TASK: Navbar dropdown open-on-hover/click + add Create Account link

AUTONOMY: LOW

GOALS
1) Public navbars: The right-side nav items that have submenus (dropdowns) must open on:
   - Hover (desktop)
   - Click/tap (mobile + desktop)
   Dropdown must close on mouse leave, Escape key, and when clicking outside.
2) Add a clear "Create account" link that routes to /register.
   Also keep /login available.
3) Do not change typography/colors/layout beyond what is required to enable dropdown behavior.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT redesign the navbar.
- Do NOT change copy except adding the label "Create account" where needed.
- Internal routing must use wouter <Link>.
- No window.location for internal routes.
- Must work for both:
  - client/src/components/Navbar.tsx (Home/dark navbar)
  - client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx (cream navbar on other pages)
  - If AppNavbar has similar right-side items, apply same dropdown behavior there too.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Add/Create Account link
- Ensure /register exists and is routed (it already should be).
- In BOTH Navbar.tsx and NavbarCream.tsx:
  - Add a right-side link: "Create account" -> /register
  - Keep existing /login entry (or add if missing).
  - For mobile menu, include both links too.

B) Dropdown behavior for menu groups
- Identify the right-side grouped items that currently require click to expand OR are static.
- Implement a small, reusable dropdown component or inline logic:
  - State: openMenuId (string | null)
  - Handlers:
    - onMouseEnter (desktop): setOpenMenuId(menuId)
    - onMouseLeave (desktop): setOpenMenuId(null)
    - onClick: toggle setOpenMenuId(menuId)
    - onKeyDown: Escape closes
  - Click-outside handler: useEffect + document.addEventListener("mousedown", ...) to close if click outside dropdown container.
- Accessibility:
  - Trigger should have aria-haspopup="menu"
  - aria-expanded={isOpen}
  - Menu container role="menu"
  - Menu items role="menuitem"
- On mobile:
  - Keep click/tap to open and close.
  - Hover should not be required.

C) Disable placeholders remain disabled
- Keep FAQ and Resources as disabled “Coming soon” spans exactly as currently implemented.
- Do not add routes for them.

FILES TO CHANGE (minimum)
- client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
- client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx
- (Optional if needed) client/src/components/AppNavbar.tsx

VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- Desktop: Hover over dropdown triggers -> menu opens; moving away closes.
- Desktop: Clicking trigger toggles menu.
- Desktop: Clicking outside closes menu.
- Desktop: Pressing Escape closes menu.
- Mobile: Tapping trigger opens/closes menu; no hover required.
- Clicking "Create account" routes to /register (SPA, no full reload).
- Clicking "Login" routes to /login.
- No console errors or duplicate key warnings.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide exact file + line ranges changed.
- Confirm behavior works on desktop and mobile.
