REPLIT TASK: Align “I don’t know yet” + “Prefer not to say” UX with spec (without breaking existing data)

Goal
- Always show TWO inline buttons under EVERY onboarding field:
  1) “I don’t know yet”
  2) “Prefer not to say”
- ALSO include these same options INSIDE every Select/Dropdown
- Standardize sentinel values to:
  - "unknown"
  - "prefer_not"
- Backwards compatible: previously-saved value "prefer_not_to_say" must still work and display correctly (treated the same as "prefer_not")

A) Standardize sentinel handling (backwards compatible)
1) Create a single shared helper (client + server safe if possible):
   - isDeferredValue(v) => true if v is "unknown" OR "prefer_not" OR "prefer_not_to_say"
   - normalizeDeferredValue(v):
       if v === "prefer_not_to_say" return "prefer_not"
       else return v

2) Update ANY UI display mapping to show:
   - "unknown" => “I don’t know yet”
   - "prefer_not" or "prefer_not_to_say" => “Prefer not to say”

3) IMPORTANT: Do NOT wipe old values. If DB contains prefer_not_to_say, treat it as prefer_not.
   Optional (nice-to-have): when user re-saves, persist the normalized "prefer_not".

B) Update UnknownControls UX per spec
Current UX hides the buttons after selection and shows a “status + clear”.
Change it to:
- ALWAYS show both buttons under every field (even when field already has a value)
- If field is currently deferred, visually indicate active state (selected styling)
- Add a small “Clear” link/button next to the buttons (optional) that resets field to "" (empty)
- Buttons should set the field value directly:
  - “I don’t know yet” => "unknown"
  - “Prefer not to say” => "prefer_not"

C) Apply UnknownControls to every onboarding field (verify coverage)
- Walk every step in AppOnboarding and ensure UnknownControls is rendered under:
  - text inputs
  - numeric inputs
  - date inputs
  - textarea inputs
  - any custom components
- Confirm children fields also have it where relevant.

D) Add sentinel values into ALL Select dropdowns
For each <SelectContent> list, prepend:
- <SelectItem value="unknown">I don’t know yet</SelectItem>
- <SelectItem value="prefer_not">Prefer not to say</SelectItem>

Do this for every select in onboarding, including:
- state selector
- case type selector
- any yes/no selectors if using Select
- anything else using Select

E) Validation updates (frontend + backend)
- Wherever validation checks “required” for onboarding, treat deferred values as valid.
- Update zod schemas / server validation to accept:
  - "unknown"
  - "prefer_not"
  - also accept "prefer_not_to_say" for backward compatibility
- If there are enums, add these values to the enum or allow union with string literals.

F) Account Settings + Case Settings edit flows
- Ensure the same controls and dropdown options exist when editing those fields later.
- If there’s a “pretty display” layer, ensure it formats deferred values consistently.

G) Report back
After implementing, provide:
1) Files changed
2) Search results count for:
   - "prefer_not_to_say" (should remain only in backward-compat normalize logic, not scattered)
   - "prefer_not" (should be used everywhere)
3) Confirm:
   - Buttons always visible under every field
   - Dropdowns include both options
   - Existing users with prefer_not_to_say still display correctly
   - Onboarding can proceed with deferred values
