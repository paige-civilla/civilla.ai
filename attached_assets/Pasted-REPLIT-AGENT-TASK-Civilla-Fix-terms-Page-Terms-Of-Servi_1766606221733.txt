REPLIT AGENT TASK (Civilla) — Fix `/terms` Page (Terms Of Service)

Goal:
Replace the current placeholder/lorem ipsum Terms page with a real, legally-safe Terms Of Service page for civilla.ai. Remove unnecessary buttons, ensure headings + button labels use Title Case (First Letter Capitalized), and keep the page clean + readable on mobile.

Do NOT re-architect. Edit only what’s needed.

---

1) FIND THE CURRENT TERMS PAGE + ROUTE
- Search for the route/path: `/terms`
- Identify the page component that renders it (likely something like:
  - `client/src/pages/Terms.tsx`
  - `client/src/pages/TermsOfService.tsx`
  - or a “policy/markdown” template page)

Acceptance:
- `/terms` loads a real Terms Of Service page (no “Heading 2 / Heading 3” or lorem ipsum anywhere).

---

2) REMOVE EXTRA HERO BUTTONS
Current hero shows two buttons like “Read” + “Back”.

Update hero CTA behavior to:
- Keep ONLY ONE primary button: **Contact Support**
  - Link it to `/contact`
- Remove “Back” entirely (users can use browser back + site nav)
- No secondary CTA in the hero

Acceptance:
- Exactly one button in the hero area on `/terms`.

---

3) TERMS OF SERVICE CONTENT (REPLACE EVERYTHING BELOW HERO)
Implement the following sections in this order, with clear headings and short paragraphs/bullets.
Use Title Case for headings (ex: “Terms Of Service”, “Limitations Of Liability”).

Include at top (under title):
- “Civilla LLC (DBA civilla.ai)”
- “Last Updated: December 24, 2025” (as a constant so we can update easily later)

CONTENT TO INSERT:

4) TABLE OF CONTENTS (OPTIONAL, BUT CLEAN)
If the page currently has a “Contents” section:
- Keep it only if it auto-links to the real headings above

- Confirm only one hero button exists
- Confirm links work: `/contact` and mailto:hello@civilla.ai (if used)

Deliverable:
- Commit the changes to the Terms page component (and any small supporting edits required).
