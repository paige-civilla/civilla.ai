REPLIT TASK: Make Lexi “Sources” produce and render real, clickable links (no 404 / no base-site fallback)

Goal
When Lexi includes Sources, every item must be a full, real URL that opens in a new tab and lands on the correct page.

A) Update Lexi system prompt to REQUIRE absolute URLs
In the Lexi chat route (server/routes.ts where the system prompt is built), add these requirements:

- If the answer includes a Sources section, each source must be a FULL URL starting with https://
- No shortened links, no “www.” without scheme, no relative paths
- Prefer official primary sources: state legislature, judiciary/courts sites, official court rules/forms pages
- If Lexi cannot find an official URL confidently, it must say so and omit the link rather than guessing

Also require a strict Sources format:

Sources:
1. Title — https://example.com/path
2. Title — https://example.com/path

B) Server-side URL cleanup/normalization (defensive)
Before storing Lexi messages (or before returning the response), run a small sanitizer on any detected URLs:
- Trim whitespace
- If a URL starts with "www.", prefix "https://"
- Reject/strip anything that isn’t http/https
- Do NOT attempt to “rebuild” URLs from base domains + paths (that’s what causes broken links)

C) Fix the frontend renderer so links are external anchors (not SPA routing)
In LexiPanel message rendering:
- Do NOT use wouter <Link> for external URLs
- Render links as:
  <a href="https://..." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline">
- If you’re using a markdown renderer (react-markdown):
  - Override the link component so it always renders as <a> with target=_blank
  - Ensure it does not pass through the SPA router

D) Optional but strongly recommended: add a “Link Preview / Copy” UX
For each source link:
- Show a small “Copy” button that copies the URL
- (Optional) Show domain label (e.g., courts.idaho.gov)

E) Add a lightweight “sources validator” for Research mode (no heavy crawling)
When Lexi returns Sources, validate each URL string:
- Must start with https://
- Must contain at least one dot in the hostname
- Must be <= 2048 chars
If any fail validation, replace Sources section with:
“Sources: unavailable (Lexi could not produce verified URLs for this answer).”

F) Acceptance tests
1) Ask: “What are the family court disclosure requirements in Idaho? Provide official sources.”
- Expect 3–5 sources that open real pages in a new tab
2) Ask: “What’s the deadline to respond to a petition in my state?”
- If Lexi cannot verify an official link, it must say it cannot and show how to find it (without guessing URLs)
3) Confirm clicking a link does NOT route inside the app and does NOT land on a base site “not found” page.

Report back
- Files changed
- Example output of a Sources section
- Confirm links open externally (target=_blank) and no router hijack
