REPLIT AGENT TASK: Safety & Support Page (US-Only) — Correct Crisis Resources + Remove Placeholder Help Number + Keep Civilla Support Email

GOAL
Update the Safety & Support page so it is accurate for a US-only product:
- Clear: if in immediate danger call 911
- Add: 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- Add: National Domestic Violence Hotline (call + text)
- Keep: Civilla support email (non-emergency)
- Remove: any fake/placeholder “Help Center” phone number sections or duplicate links

STEP 1 — FIND THE FILE
Run:
rg -n "Safety\\b|Safety & Support|In crisis|support@civilla\\.ai|Help Center|Hotline|1-800-799|911|988" client/src

Open the page component that renders Safety & Support (likely client/src/pages/SafetySupport.tsx or similar).

STEP 2 — UPDATE THE TOP HERO COPY
Replace the hero content with:

Eyebrow (if present): “Safety”
Heading: “In Crisis”
Body paragraph:
“If you’re in immediate danger, call 911. Civilla is not an emergency service. Use Quick Exit if you need to leave this site quickly.”

STEP 3 — REPLACE THE CONTENT BLOCKS / CARDS WITH THESE (US ONLY)

A) CARD: Resources
Title: “Resources”
Body: “Learn about safety planning and find support options near you.”
(If there is a self-link to “Safety & Support” on the same page, remove that link and keep only text.)

B) CARD: Civilla Support (Non-Emergency)
Title: “Civilla Support (Non-Emergency)”
Body: “For account or site issues, email us anytime. If you’re in danger, call 911.”
Link: support@civilla.ai as mailto
href="mailto:support@civilla.ai"

C) CARD: Crisis Support (U.S.)
Title: “Crisis Support (U.S.)”
Body: “Call or text 988 for free, confidential support 24/7.”

D) CARD: Domestic Violence Support (U.S.)
Title: “Domestic Violence Support (U.S.)”
Body (exact):
“National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233. Text ‘START’ to 88788.”

Optional second line (if there’s a subtitle slot):
“Chat and local provider search are available at TheHotline.org.”

STEP 4 — REMOVE PLACEHOLDER “HELP” PHONE SECTION
Delete any section that:
- Shows a Civilla “Help” phone number you don’t own
- Says “Visit our Help Center for answers” (if it’s duplicated or irrelevant)
- Repeats the same link multiple times

Keep the page clean: one Resources block, one Civilla Support block, and the two US crisis resources (988 + DV hotline).

STEP 5 — BOTTOM SAFETY LINE
Add a small muted line at the bottom of the page:
“Educational, Research, And Organizational Support — Not Legal Advice Or Representation.”

VERIFY
- Mobile layout looks clean (no duplicates)
- support@civilla.ai opens email composer
- 988 and DV hotline info is visible and correct
- No placeholder numbers remain
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- File edited + exact line ranges changed
- Which placeholder sections were removed
