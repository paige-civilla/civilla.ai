REPLIT AGENT TASK: Redesign Public Dropdown Menu To “Old App” Style (Keep Green Navbars) + Heart Support Icon + Expanded “About” Links (No Page Title Changes)

GOAL
Update BOTH public navbars so the dropdown menu looks like the old app (clean card, section headers, icons),
WHILE keeping the NAVBAR ITSELF green on Home AND all other pages (Navbar + NavbarCream both green).
Also:
- Support header icon must be a HEART
- Replace the single “About” column with an “About Civilla” group that contains:
  Our Mission, Meet the Founders, About Us (labels only; do NOT rename page titles)

FILES TO EDIT
- client/src/components/Navbar.tsx
- client/src/components/NavbarCream.tsx
(Reference-only: existing green styles in Navbar.tsx)

PART A — KEEP NAVBAR GREEN EVERYWHERE
1) Make sure BOTH Navbar.tsx and NavbarCream.tsx use the SAME green navbar background styling.
   - In NavbarCream.tsx, replace any light/cream navbar background classes with the same green classes used by Navbar.tsx.
   - Keep the navbar text/icons readable (white or near-white) on the green background.
   - IMPORTANT: This instruction is ONLY for the top navbar bar — the dropdown panel will be a cream “card.”

PART B — ICON IMPORTS (BOTH FILES)
2) Ensure these Lucide icons are imported (add/remove as needed):
Header icons:
- Sparkles
- Info
- ShieldCheck
- Heart   ✅ REQUIRED for Support header
Link icons:
- Home
- CreditCard
- HelpCircle
- Info (reuse ok)
- FileText
- Lock
- Mail
- LogIn

PART C — MENU DATA (BOTH FILES)
3) Update the dropdown structure to use these sections + labels + routes (do NOT change page titles):

SECTION 1 HEADER: “Start Here” (icon: Sparkles)
Links:
- Home (Home) → /
- Plans & Pricing (CreditCard) → /plans
- How Civilla Works (HelpCircle) → /how-civilla-works

SECTION 2 HEADER: “About Civilla” (icon: Info)
Links:
- Our Mission (Info) → /about#mission
- Meet The Founders (Info) → /about#founders
- About Us (Info) → /about

SECTION 3 HEADER: “Trust & Safety” (icon: ShieldCheck)
Links:
- Safety & Support (ShieldCheck) → /safety-support
- Legal & Compliance (FileText) → /legal-compliance
- Accessibility (Lock) → /accessibility

SECTION 4 HEADER: “Support” (icon: Heart) ✅ HEART ICON REQUIRED
Links:
- Contact (Mail) → /contact
- Privacy Policy (Lock) → /privacy-policy
- Terms of Service (FileText) → /terms
- Login (LogIn) → /login

Keep disabled “Soon” items at the bottom of “Start Here”:
- FAQ — Soon (disabled)
- Resources — Soon (disabled)

PART D — DROPDOWN VISUAL REDESIGN (BOTH FILES)
4) Replace the dropdown panel styling so it resembles the old app menu:
- Dropdown panel background: bg-[#e7ebea] (cream card)
- Border: border border-black/10
- Radius: rounded-2xl
- Shadow: shadow-xl
- Text inside panel: text-neutral-900
- Padding: p-6 (mobile) / p-8 (desktop)

5) Position + sizing:
- Mobile: fixed inset-x-3 top-[72px] (or match actual navbar height), max-h-[75vh] overflow-auto
- Desktop: absolute right-4 top-full mt-3 w-[min(900px,calc(100vw-2rem))]

6) Layout inside dropdown:
- Use: grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4
- Each section header row:
  flex items-center gap-2 text-xs font-semibold tracking-widest uppercase text-neutral-700
- Underline under each section header:
  mt-2 h-px w-full bg-black/10

7) Link row styling:
- flex items-center gap-3 py-2 text-[15px] text-neutral-900/90 hover:text-neutral-900
- icon size: h-4 w-4 opacity-70

8) Disabled “Soon” items:
- Render as non-clickable text with opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed
- Add “Soon” to the right in text-[11px] opacity-60

PART E — ABOUT ANCHOR SUPPORT (LIGHT SAFETY NET)
9) Check if /about page contains sections with ids “mission” and “founders”.
Search:
rg -n "id=\\\"mission\\\"|id=\\\"founders\\\"" client/src/pages
If missing, add minimal anchor targets to the existing About page (AboutCivilla):
- Add <div id="mission" /> immediately above the Mission section heading (or near top if no section exists)
- Add <div id="founders" /> immediately above the Founders section heading (or where founders are described)
Do NOT rewrite the about page copy; only add anchor ids so the menu links work.

VERIFY
- Navbar stays green on Home AND other pages (NavbarCream updated to match)
- Dropdown opens as a cream card (old app vibe) on both navbars
- “Support” section uses HEART icon
- /login item routes to /login
- /about#mission and /about#founders scroll appropriately (if anchors exist)
- No lint/type errors

REPORT BACK
- Exact line ranges changed in Navbar.tsx and NavbarCream.tsx
- Whether About anchors existed or were added (and file/lines)
