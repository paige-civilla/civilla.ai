READ-ONLY AUDIT: Civilla Frontend Pages, Routes, Navigation, and Responsive Behavior
Do NOT debug, refactor, redesign, or change code. Do NOT generate new components. Audit only.

GOAL
Confirm that all desktop + mobile Figma pages are implemented, routed correctly, navigable, responsive, and consistent with expected behavior (logo → home, nav links, hamburger menu). Identify missing pages, broken routes, overflow issues, and disconnected components.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a concise report with:
1) Page Inventory (table)
2) Route Map (table)
3) Navigation + Linking Checks (checklist)
4) Responsive/Layout Issues (bulleted, with file paths + line numbers)
5) Broken/Missing Items (bulleted)
6) “Fix Plan” (high-level only, no code)

AUDIT STEPS

A) PAGE INVENTORY
1. List all page components under:
   - client/src/pages/**
   Include: filename, exported component name, and whether it’s used by App routing.

B) ROUTE MAP
2. Open client/src/App.tsx and list every <Route ...> including:
   - path
   - component/page file
   - auth protection (if any)
   - redirects (e.g., /pricing -> /subscribe)
3. Identify any pages that exist but have NO route.

C) NAVIGATION + LINKING
4. Audit Navbar:
   - file path: client/src/components/Navbar.tsx (or equivalent)
   Check:
   - Links point to correct routes and do not 404
   - Mobile hamburger menu opens/closes correctly
   - Menu contains the intended page links
   - Current-page active state styling (if present)
5. Confirm logo click behavior:
   - On every page, clicking the Civilla logo routes to "/"
   - Specify where implemented (Navbar logo link or click handler)
6. Audit Footer links:
   - list all href targets and confirm each route exists

D) RESPONSIVE + OVERFLOW (CRITICAL)
7. Run a quick scan for layout overflow risks:
   - Look for: fixed widths, absolute positioning, hardcoded px widths, missing max-w, missing flex-wrap, missing overflow-hidden, long unbroken strings
   - Identify the TOP 10 likely offenders with file path + line range.
8. Specifically check for “text leaving the box” behavior:
   - Identify any elements missing:
     - min-w-0 on flex children
     - max-w-full
     - break-words / break-all (only where needed)
     - overflow-hidden / text-ellipsis (only where needed)
9. Confirm mobile breakpoints are present on:
   - Hero
   - Tabs/Tools section
   - Testimonials/cards
   - FAQ accordion
   - Pricing cards (if built)
   - Footer columns

E) ROUTE BEHAVIOR
10. Confirm navigation works without full reload:
   - If using wouter/react-router, confirm links use <Link> not window.location.href (except where intentional).
11. Confirm 404 handling:
   - Is there a fallback “Not Found” route?
   - If missing, note it (do not implement).

F) ASSETS + FIGMA PARITY
12. List how logos/images are loaded:
   - local assets vs external URLs
   - confirm correct “dark logo” usage on dark navbar (if present)
13. Note any missing Figma sections or mismatched page order, based on current page structure.

DELIVERABLE
Provide:
- A route map table
- A list of pages not wired to routes
- A list of broken links (if any)
- A list of overflow/responsive issues with exact file paths + line numbers
- A short “what to fix first” prioritization (P0/P1/P2)
