TASK: Enforce Design System Continuity for ALL authenticated (post-login) app pages.

AUTONOMY: LOW
Do not redesign public marketing pages.
Do not change copy on existing public pages.
Do not introduce new colors, fonts, or UI patterns.

GOAL
Every logged-in page must visually match the existing Figma-based frontend:
- Same fonts (Figtree for headings, Arimo for body)
- Same color tokens (bush green, cream/off-white, neutral-darkest, etc.)
- Same component styling (buttons/cards/inputs/layout spacing)
No “default shadcn” look, no random Tailwind greens/blues, no new palettes.

RULES (HARD)
1) ALL colors must come from the token system already implemented (CSS variables + tailwind mapping). 
   - Do NOT use bg-green-*, text-green-*, or hardcoded hex values.
2) ALL typography must use the existing font setup and typography classes already used on Home.
3) ALL buttons must use the existing shared Button component (or the existing design-locked button variant).
4) ALL cards/containers must use the existing Card/container patterns from the Figma build.
5) Logged-in layout must reuse the same Navbar/Footer style system (or a locked “AppNavbar” built from the same tokens).
6) If any new component is needed (inputs, dropdowns, tabs), it must be built in the same design language:
   - border radius matches Figma
   - border color uses token
   - focus ring uses token
   - spacing matches the existing sections

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Create ONE shared “App Layout” wrapper for authenticated routes:
  - File: client/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx (or existing layout folder)
  - Includes:
    - AppNavbar (can be a variant of NavbarCream/Navbar) using the same tokens
    - main content container with the same max-width and padding rules
- Update authenticated pages to render inside AppLayout.
- Build/adjust minimal UI components needed for auth pages (Login/Register/Magic Link/Cases):
  - Use same tokens, fonts, and button styles as the Home page.
  - Reuse existing components where possible.
- Add a lint-like check (manual, not a library):
  - Search for forbidden classes: bg-green-, text-green-, border-green-, blue-, purple-, etc.
  - Replace with token-based classes.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (must confirm after changes)
- Login/Register pages match Home typography + color palette
- Authenticated navbar looks like it belongs to Civilla (not a template)
- No hardcoded colors or Tailwind default palettes
- No horizontal overflow on 320px
- Buttons, inputs, cards match design language across pages

DELIVERABLE
- List of files changed
- Confirmation that no marketing pages were modified
- A short “design continuity audit” showing:
  - 0 hardcoded hex colors added
  - 0 Tailwind default palette classes added (green/blue/purple/etc.)
