GOAL
On the Home hero, keep everything LEFT-aligned, but force the subtitle (“Bring your case…”) to never extend wider than the H1’s text block.

WHY THE LAST TRY DIDN’T WORK
A fixed max-width like 42ch won’t perfectly match the H1 width across screen sizes/font rendering.
We need the subtitle’s width to be controlled by the H1 width.

STEP-BY-STEP (NO FILE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED)

1) Locate the Home hero text
- In Replit: press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F (Search all files)
- Search for EXACT text: Family Law,
  (or search: Family Law, Translated)
- Open the file where that string appears (likely Home page or a Hero component)

2) Find the H1 and the subtitle paragraph under it
You’re looking for markup shaped like:
<h1>Family Law, ...</h1>
<p>Bring your case into one clear place — ...</p>

3) Wrap the H1 + P in a “fit-to-heading” wrapper
- Add a wrapper div around the h1 and p
- Make wrapper inline-block so its width becomes the width of the H1 text block
- Make the paragraph w-full so it matches that wrapper width (therefore matching H1 width)

IMPLEMENTATION (TAILWIND)

BEFORE (example shape):
<h1 className="...">Family Law, Translated.</h1>
<p className="...">Bring your case into one clear place — ...</p>

AFTER:
<div className="inline-block max-w-full align-top">
  <h1 className="...">Family Law, Translated.</h1>
  <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-white/90 w-full text-pretty">
    Bring your case into one clear place — so you can understand what you're seeing, stay organized, and prepare with less stress.
  </p>
</div>

IMPORTANT NOTES
- Do NOT add text-center anywhere.
- Keep the existing left alignment and spacing.
- If the paragraph already has max-w-[xx], REMOVE that max-w so w-full can take over.

4) Verify in Preview
- The subtitle should now wrap exactly under the H1 block and never extend farther right than the “Family Law,” line.
- If it still overflows, add: "break-words" to the paragraph className.

OPTIONAL (IF text-pretty isn’t supported)
Replace text-pretty with:
"leading-relaxed"
(or just remove it)
