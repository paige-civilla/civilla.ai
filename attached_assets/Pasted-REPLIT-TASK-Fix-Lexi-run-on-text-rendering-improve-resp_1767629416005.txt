REPLIT TASK: Fix Lexi “run-on text” rendering + improve response formatting + adjust colors (Quick Exit + module tiles)

GOALS
1) Lexi responses must display with real paragraph breaks and bullets (no run-on wrapping).
2) Lexi must be instructed to format answers as readable sections (bullets, steps, short paragraphs).
3) Quick Exit button must use a muted green gradient that matches the civilla logo (not neon).
4) Module tile background should be “half as blue” as current (#C3D5D7 → lighter).

A) FIX LEXI MESSAGE RENDERING (preserve newlines)
In: client/src/components/lexi/LexiPanel.tsx (or wherever the assistant message bubble is rendered)

- Ensure the assistant message content preserves line breaks:
  - Add `whitespace-pre-wrap` to the message container that displays assistant content.
  - If you are using a <p> tag that collapses whitespace, switch to a <div>.

Example:
<div className="whitespace-pre-wrap leading-relaxed">
  {message.content}
</div>

If you are already using ReactMarkdown, ensure it respects breaks:
- Use remark-gfm and set `components` so paragraphs/lists render correctly.
- If needed, also set `className="prose whitespace-pre-wrap"` or add `breaks: true`.

B) FORCE LEXI OUTPUT STYLE (server prompt)
In: server/routes.ts (Lexi chat handler where system prompt / messages are assembled)

Add/replace a SYSTEM formatting instruction so Lexi always returns readable structure:
- Short paragraphs (max 2–3 sentences)
- Use headings + bullets when helpful
- Never use inline “Details: - item - item - item” on one line
- Prefer:
  - “Quick answer”
  - “Key points”
  - “Steps”
  - “What to gather”
  - “Questions to ask your court / attorney”
- Always include blank lines between sections.

Add something like:

SYSTEM STYLE RULES (append to Lexi system prompt):
"Formatting rules:
- Use Markdown.
- Use blank lines between paragraphs/sections.
- Use bullet lists for lists (no hyphen run-ons).
- Keep paragraphs under 3 lines.
- If you write 'Quick answer', put it on its own line, then a blank line.
- Never output 'Details: - ... - ...' on a single line."

C) QUICK EXIT BUTTON GRADIENT (match logo, not neon)
Find the Quick Exit button styling (likely AppNavbar / layout component).

- Replace the current bright gradient with a muted “logo-like” gradient.
Use:
  start: #1F5A3A
  end:   #4E9A5B
And a subtle hover:
  hover start: #1B5134
  hover end:   #438C53

Implement as Tailwind:
bg-gradient-to-r from-[#1F5A3A] to-[#4E9A5B]
hover:from-[#1B5134] hover:to-[#438C53]

Make text white and keep the same rounded/outline styles.

D) MODULE TILE BACKGROUND “HALF AS BLUE”
We previously normalized module tiles to CSS tokens in client/src/index.css.

Update:
--module-tile

From:
--module-tile: 186 20% 80%   (≈ #C3D5D7)

To a lighter “half-blue” value:
Use the midpoint between #C3D5D7 and the lighter neutral #E4ECED:
Midpoint = #D4E0E2

So set:
--module-tile: 186 22% 86%;   (approx)  OR directly compute to match #D4E0E2 in HSL

Keep border/icon tokens as-is unless contrast is lost.

E) REPORT BACK
After changes:
1) List files changed
2) Confirm Lexi outputs show real paragraph breaks + bullets in UI
3) Confirm Quick Exit looks like logo (muted gradient)
4) Confirm module tile background is lighter and consistent across dashboard + Start Here + module pages
