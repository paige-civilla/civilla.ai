Replit — Update the “All Cases” page layout order.

Desired layout order (top → bottom):
1) The list/grid of existing cases (most recent first, with the one they just created at the very top)
2) The “Upgrade to add more cases” paywall/notice (ONLY if user is at their casesAllowed limit)
3) The “Create New Case” form/button section at the bottom

Current issue:
Right now the page shows upgrade + create new case above the cases list. Flip it.

Files:
- Find the Cases page component (likely one of):
  client/src/pages/AppCases.tsx
  client/src/pages/Cases.tsx
  client/src/pages/AppAllCases.tsx
Search keywords: “Upgrade”, “casesAllowed”, “Create New Case”, “Create your first case”, “View all cases”.

Implementation steps:

A) Ensure sorting: newest case first
- Wherever cases array is derived, sort by createdAt DESC (or updatedAt if that’s what you have).
Example:
  const sortedCases = [...cases].sort((a,b) =>
    new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime()
  );

B) Reorder JSX sections
- Render sections in this order:

  1) Existing cases list (ALWAYS first)
     - If there are zero cases: show the empty state here (top).
     - If cases exist: show the list/grid here.

  2) Upgrade block (CONDITIONAL)
     - Only show if `cases.length >= user.casesAllowed` (or the equivalent logic already used).
     - This block should be between the case list and the create form.

  3) Create New Case section (ALWAYS last)
     - If the user is at limit, the create form should either:
       - be disabled with helper text “Upgrade to create another case”, OR
       - be hidden (your choice), but the section header can still show.
     - If not at limit, normal create flow.

C) UX details
- If user is at limit:
  - Keep “Create New Case” section visible but disabled (preferred), so they understand where it would be.
  - Put a short line of helper text inside create section: “You’ve reached your case limit. Upgrade to add another case.”
- If user is NOT at limit:
  - Hide the upgrade block entirely.

D) Verify behavior
- Create a new case:
  - It should appear at the top of the list immediately.
  - The upgrade notice should appear only if they hit the limit.
  - The create form should remain at bottom (or disabled if at limit).

After changes, paste back:
- The updated JSX order from the Cases page component (just the relevant section)
- The condition you used to show the upgrade block
- Confirmation that cases are sorted newest-first
