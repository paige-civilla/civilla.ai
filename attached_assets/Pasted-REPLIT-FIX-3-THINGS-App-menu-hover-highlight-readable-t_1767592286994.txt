REPLIT — FIX 3 THINGS (App menu hover highlight + readable text + solid dropdown background + “If you’re in crisis” home hero box color)

A) APP NAVBAR DROPDOWN: Make it SOLID (not transparent / not showing page behind)
1) Open: client/src/components/layout/AppNavbar.tsx
2) Find the dropdown panel container (the element that appears when the menu opens).
   It will look like a div with classes similar to: "bg-..." "border" "shadow" "absolute" etc.
3) Ensure the dropdown panel has:
   - a solid background color
   - an explicit opacity of 100
   - a high z-index
   - no backdrop blur / transparency classes

Use these exact classes on the DROPDOWN PANEL CONTAINER:
- bg-[#E4ECED]
- opacity-100
- z-[60]
- shadow-lg
- border border-[#628286]

Example (adapt to your exact JSX structure):
<div className="absolute right-0 top-full mt-2 w-[min(720px,calc(100vw-16px))] bg-[#E4ECED] opacity-100 z-[60] shadow-lg border border-[#628286] rounded-xl">

Also remove any of these if present on the dropdown panel:
- bg-white/xx, bg-black/xx, bg-*/xx
- backdrop-blur*
- opacity-*
- bg-transparent

B) APP NAVBAR DROPDOWN: Hover highlight is too dark + text gets lost
Goal:
- Hover highlight should be lighter blue/teal and readable.
- On hover: background becomes #A2BEC2 and text becomes WHITE.
- Default text color stays dark (#243032 or current foreground).

1) In AppNavbar.tsx find the dropdown menu item element (button/link).
2) Replace hover classes with these (exact):
- hover:bg-[#A2BEC2]
- hover:text-white
- focus:bg-[#A2BEC2]
- focus:text-white
- active:bg-[#A2BEC2]
- active:text-white

Keep a smooth transition:
- transition-colors

Example for a dropdown item:
className="w-full text-left rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-[#243032] hover:bg-[#A2BEC2] hover:text-white focus:bg-[#A2BEC2] focus:text-white active:bg-[#A2BEC2] active:text-white transition-colors"

Dark mode:
If you have dark mode classes on these items, keep them, but ensure hover still stays readable.
If dark mode currently makes hover unreadable, force the hover text to white in dark mode too:
- dark:hover:text-white
- dark:focus:text-white

C) HOME PAGE: “If you’re in crisis” hero box should be DARK GREEN
1) Find the component/page that renders that box.
   Likely one of:
   - client/src/pages/Landing.tsx
   - client/src/components/CTASection.tsx
   - client/src/components/TestimonialsSection.tsx
   - client/src/components/ToolsSection.tsx
   - or another marketing component

Search for the text “If you’re in crisis” and open the file that contains it.
2) Update the container classes for that hero box to use the dark green theme:
- background: #0F3B2E
- text: #FAF8F4
- border (optional): a darker green or subtle border

Example:
className="rounded-2xl bg-[#0F3B2E] text-[#FAF8F4] border border-[#0C2F24] p-6"

Also ensure links inside the box are readable:
- underline + text-[#FAF8F4]
- hover:text-[#CFD7D5] (optional)

D) CONFIRMATION CHECKLIST (tell me in your summary)
After changes, confirm:
1) Dropdown panel is fully solid (no bleed-through of page behind it).
2) Hover highlight is lighter (#A2BEC2) and text remains readable (white on hover).
3) Crisis hero box is dark green (#0F3B2E) with cream text (#FAF8F4).
4) Screenshots: one of dropdown open + hover state, and one of the crisis hero box.

IMPORTANT: In your final response, list the exact files changed and paste the exact className snippets you updated so we can verify quickly.
