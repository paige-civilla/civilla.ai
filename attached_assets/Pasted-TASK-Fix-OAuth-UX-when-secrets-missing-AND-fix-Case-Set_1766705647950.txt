TASK: Fix OAuth UX when secrets missing AND fix Case Settings routing to be caseId-based

AUTONOMY: LOW

DO NOT:
- Add new features beyond this task
- Change marketing pages
- Redesign UI, spacing, colors, or copy beyond adding minimal disabled text states
- Remove existing ownership enforcement

PART 1: OAUTH CONFIG STATUS AND UI DISABLE

Goal: OAuth buttons must not be clickable unless provider env vars are configured.

Backend:
1) Add GET /api/auth/oauth-status
Return JSON like:
{
  "google": true/false,
  "apple": true/false
}
Compute booleans by checking required env vars exist.
Google requires: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL
Apple requires at least: APPLE_CLIENT_ID, APPLE_REDIRECT_URL
If Apple implementation requires more keys in your code, include them too.

Frontend:
2) In Login.tsx and Register.tsx:
- Fetch /api/auth/oauth-status on load
- If google is false, render the Google button disabled (button disabled attribute)
- If apple is false, render the Apple button disabled
- Disabled styling must use existing Civilla tokens (reduced opacity, cursor-not-allowed)
- Disabled buttons must not navigate or call start endpoints
- Add small helper text under disabled buttons: "Coming soon" or "Sign-in temporarily unavailable"

Also:
3) In server/oauth.ts, keep the existing 500 behavior for missing env vars, but the UI should prevent users from hitting it.

PART 2: CASE SETTINGS ROUTE MUST INCLUDE CASE ID

Goal: Case Settings must be unambiguous and always load the intended case.

Routing:
1) Change Case Settings route from /app/case to /app/case/:caseId

Frontend:
2) Update AppNavbar "Case Settings" link:
- Determine active caseId from localStorage selectedCaseId
- If missing, fetch /api/cases and pick the first caseId
- Link must be /app/case/{caseId}
If no cases exist, send user to /app/cases

3) Update CaseSettings page to read caseId from params and call:
GET /api/cases/:caseId
PATCH /api/cases/:caseId

Backend:
4) Ensure GET /api/cases/:caseId exists with ownership enforcement.
If it does not exist, add it using storage.getCase(caseId, userId).
PATCH already exists.

DELIVERABLES:
- List files changed
- Confirm OAuth buttons are disabled when secrets missing
- Confirm Case Settings works for a specific caseId and cannot edit the wrong case
- No console errors
