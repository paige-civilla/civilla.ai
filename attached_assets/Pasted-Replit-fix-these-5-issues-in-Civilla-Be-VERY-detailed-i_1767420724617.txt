Replit — fix these 5 issues in Civilla. Be VERY detailed in your final summary: list every file changed, what lines/sections, and what behavior changed.

========================================================
1) APP NAV DROPDOWN IS TRANSPARENT (shows page underneath)
========================================================
Problem: The AppNavbar dropdown panel is not solid, it’s visually picking up the page behind it.

Fix:
- In client/src/components/layout/AppNavbar.tsx (or wherever the dropdown panel is rendered)
  - Ensure the dropdown container has:
    - a solid background color (NO transparency)
    - no backdrop blur that makes it see-through
    - a high z-index above all content
  - Example class changes (use our app tokens):
    - add: "bg-background" (which should be #FAF8F4 in app theme)
    - add: "border border-[var(--border)]"
    - add: "shadow-lg"
    - add: "z-[9999]"
    - remove any "bg-*/xx" opacity classes like bg-white/70, bg-background/70, etc.
    - remove backdrop-blur if present (or keep blur but still solid: bg-background + no opacity)

Also confirm the dropdown wrapper is positioned correctly and not inheriting opacity.

========================================================
2) ONBOARDING LOOPS BACK TO STEP 0 EVERY TIME
========================================================
Problem: user cannot complete onboarding; after finishing, they get sent back to beginning.

Fix approach:
A) Verify onboarding completion field exists and is persisted
- In shared/schema.ts user_profiles table MUST include:
  - onboardingCompleted boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false
  (If it exists already, confirm naming matches exactly what frontend checks.)

B) Ensure DB table creation and runtime init includes it
- In server/db.ts initTable("user_profiles", CREATE TABLE ...) ensure onboarding_completed column exists in the base CREATE TABLE statement.
- Also add a safety ALTER in initDbTables():
  ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

C) Ensure the endpoint that saves onboarding sets onboardingCompleted true
- Find the onboarding “Finish” handler on the client (client/src/pages/AppOnboarding.tsx)
- Confirm it calls a backend route that updates user_profiles (or case + profile) AND sets onboarding_completed=true.
- If you already have PATCH /api/user/profile or /api/profile/upsert, extend it so “finish onboarding” sets onboardingCompleted.

D) Ensure routing logic doesn’t mis-detect completion
- In AppLayout (or the onboarding guard), ensure it checks:
  profile.onboardingCompleted === true
  not just “profile exists” or “has required fields”.
- After successful completion, redirect user to the dashboard route (whatever current is, likely /app/dashboard or /app).

E) Add a small debug-friendly safeguard (no console spam):
- If onboarding redirect triggers even when onboardingCompleted=true, fix the condition and add one warning log server-side only in dev.

========================================================
3) CLEAR ALL USERS + FAKE DATA FROM DATABASE (RESET DEV DB)
========================================================
Goal: wipe ALL users and related data so DB is empty.

Implement a dev-only reset script (safer than random manual deletes):
- Create server/scripts/resetDevDb.ts
  - Connect using DATABASE_URL
  - Run TRUNCATE with CASCADE on all tables that store user/case data:
    users,
    user_profiles,
    auth_magic_links,
    auth_identities,
    cases,
    timeline_events,
    evidence_files,
    documents,
    generated_documents,
    case_children,
    tasks,
    deadlines,
    case_contacts,
    case_communications,
    exhibit_lists,
    exhibits,
    exhibit_evidence,
    calendar_categories,
    case_calendar_items,
    lexi_threads,
    lexi_messages
  - Use:
    TRUNCATE TABLE <tables...> RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

- Add npm script in package.json:
  "reset:devdb": "tsx server/scripts/resetDevDb.ts"

Important:
- Make script refuse to run if NODE_ENV === "production" (hard stop).
- Print a clear success message.

========================================================
4) TEXTBOX INTERIOR COLOR SHOULD BE A LITTLE BLUER
========================================================
Right now textboxes are green-ish (#CFD7D5). Make it slightly bluer while staying soft.

Update ONLY authenticated app textbox interior:
- In client/src/index.css inside .theme-app (or .app-shell), set:
  --input: <new bluish value>
Use:
  #D6E4E6   (slightly bluer than #CFD7D5, still soft)
- Ensure Input + Textarea use bg-input (not hardcoded hex).
- Keep webkit autofill override aligned to new input color:
  -webkit-box-shadow inset should use the same new --input color.

Do NOT change marketing theme inputs unless they share the same component and we explicitly scope it by theme class.

========================================================
5) QUICK EXIT BUTTON SHOULD MATCH MARKETING CREAM NAVBAR GREEN GRADIENT
========================================================
Goal: the quick exit icon/button in the app should use the same green gradient styling as the cream navbar (marketing).

- Locate the quick exit button component (likely in AppNavbar / QuickExitButton).
- Apply a gradient background equivalent to marketing navbar styling, e.g.:
  bg-gradient-to-b (or to-r)
  from-bush to-bush-dark
  text-cream
  hover: slightly darker or increase contrast (e.g. from-bush-dark to-bush)
- Ensure it keeps accessibility:
  - minimum 44px tap target on mobile
  - clear focus ring using border/ring token

========================================================
DELIVERABLE
========================================================
After implementing:
- Confirm dropdown is solid (no bleed-through).
- Confirm onboarding completes ONCE and always redirects to dashboard.
- Confirm reset:devdb wipes all users and data in dev without affecting production.
- Confirm textbox interior is slightly bluer only in app theme.
- Confirm quick exit matches the green gradient.
