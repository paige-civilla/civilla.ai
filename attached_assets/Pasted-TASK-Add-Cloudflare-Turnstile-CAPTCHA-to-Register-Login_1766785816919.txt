TASK: Add Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA to Register + Login (production-safe)

AUTONOMY: LOW

GOAL
Protect /api/auth/register and /api/auth/login from bots on civilla.ai using Cloudflare Turnstile.
Must work on both the deployed domain and dev/preview.
Do NOT change site layout, typography, or colors beyond inserting the widget area cleanly.

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT change marketing pages.
- Do NOT add new auth methods.
- Do NOT break existing login/register flows.
- Use wouter routing; do not introduce full page reloads.

REQUIRED SECRETS / ENV VARS
- TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY (public)
- TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY (server)
If missing in dev, the UI should still render and the backend should fail-soft (allow dev if NODE_ENV !== "production").

IMPLEMENTATION
1) Backend verification helper
- Create server/turnstile.ts (or equivalent) with verifyTurnstile(token, ip?) that POSTs to:
  https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify
- Return { ok: boolean, error?: string }.
- Do NOT log secrets. Mask/avoid dumping request bodies.

2) Enforce verification on auth routes (production only)
- In server/routes.ts:
  - For POST /api/auth/register: require a turnstile token from body (e.g. turnstileToken)
  - For POST /api/auth/login: same
  - If NODE_ENV === "production" and token missing/invalid -> return 400 with JSON:
    { error: "captcha_required" } or { error: "captcha_failed" }
  - If not production and secrets missing -> allow (dev bypass), but keep code path intact.

3) Frontend: Login + Register pages
- Add Turnstile widget using TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY.
- Load Turnstile script once (client/index.html or a small React hook).
- On successful challenge, store token in component state and include it in the POST payload:
  - register payload includes turnstileToken
  - login payload includes turnstileToken
- If backend returns captcha_required/captcha_failed, show a friendly inline error and reset the widget.

4) UX requirements
- Keep the look consistent with Civilla tokens and spacing.
- Place the Turnstile widget just above the submit button.
- Ensure 320px mobile width has no overflow.

5) Validation checklist (must confirm in summary)
- On civilla.ai (published):
  - register fails with captcha_required if not completed
  - register succeeds when completed
  - login fails with captcha_required if not completed
  - login succeeds when completed
- In dev/preview:
  - forms still work even if secrets are not set (dev bypass)
- No console errors.

DELIVERABLE
- List exact files changed + line ranges.
- Confirm payload field name used (turnstileToken).
- Confirm production behavior vs dev bypass behavior.
