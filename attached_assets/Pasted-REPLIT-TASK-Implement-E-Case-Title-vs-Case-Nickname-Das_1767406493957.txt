REPLIT TASK: Implement “E” = Case Title vs Case Nickname + Dashboard/Header UX polish

GOAL
Give each case:
1) A formal “Case Title” (used in Case Settings + exports where needed)
2) A “Case Nickname” (used on the Case Dashboard / Case Workspace header)
Also clean up the Dashboard/Case header UI per Paige’s notes.

REQUIREMENTS
- No breaking changes to existing routes.
- Keep all existing case IDs and relationships.
- If a nickname is empty, fall back to Case Title everywhere.

BACKEND / DB
1) Update schema
- In shared/schema.ts, add these columns to the cases table:
  - nickname (TEXT, nullable)
  - caseNumber (TEXT, nullable)   // only if not already present in cases; do NOT duplicate if stored elsewhere
- Update insertCaseSchema / updateCaseSchema to accept nickname and caseNumber (optional/nullable).
- Add appropriate max length validations (e.g. nickname 80, caseNumber 80).

2) Migrations / init
- In server/db.ts:
  - If using CREATE TABLE for cases, include nickname + case_number columns.
  - Also add addColumnIfNotExists for cases.nickname and cases.case_number so existing DBs update cleanly.

3) API
- Ensure existing case update endpoint accepts nickname and caseNumber and persists them.
- Ensure GET case endpoints return nickname and caseNumber.

FRONTEND
4) Case Settings page
- In AppCaseSettings.tsx (or wherever case settings edits happen):
  - Add two editable fields:
    - “Case Title (official)” -> maps to cases.title
    - “Case Nickname (what you’ll see in your dashboard)” -> maps to cases.nickname
  - Add helper text explaining the difference in plain language.
  - Add “Case Number” field if it belongs here (or show it read-only with edit, depending on current structure).
  - Save should update the case immediately (use existing mutation).

5) Case Dashboard / Case Workspace header
- In AppDashboard.tsx and AppCase.tsx:
  - Replace the large header case name with:
    - Primary header: nickname if present else title
    - Secondary small text: title if nickname is present (so users still see the official name)
  - Reduce the size so it doesn’t dominate the page.
  - Centering:
    - Keep left-aligned on desktop for readability, but allow centered on mobile if the layout looks better.
    - Use responsive classes so it never overflows or wraps awkwardly.

6) “View All Cases” button polish
- Convert “View All Cases” into a smaller button:
  - Use app primary color (#314143) with text #FAF8F4
  - Add a strong border (use #1E2020 or border token) and consistent hover.
  - Ensure it doesn’t visually compete with the main CTA.
  - Keep min-h 44px for mobile accessibility.

QUALITY / ACCEPTANCE TESTS
- Create/edit case nickname -> immediately reflected on dashboard/workspace header.
- Nickname empty -> dashboard shows title, no weird blank.
- Existing cases load without errors (migration safe).
- No layout overflow at 320px width.
- No console errors.
