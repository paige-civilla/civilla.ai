# REPLIT TASK: Reduce button clutter + tighten “Can / Cannot” copy + Title Case headings
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT edit Home, How Civilla Works, Plans & Pricing, Footer, NavbarCream, or Navbar (green). Only edit:
# - Legal Compliance page (route: /legal-compliance)
# - Contact page (route: /contact)

================================================================================
PART A) LEGAL COMPLIANCE — make the “CAN / CANNOT” section shorter + less wordy
================================================================================

1) Open the Legal Compliance page file:
- Look for one of these (use search):
  - client/src/pages/LegalCompliance.tsx
  - client/src/pages/LegalAndCompliance.tsx
  - client/src/pages/legal-compliance.tsx
  - or whichever file is wired to route "/legal-compliance"

2) Find the section that currently renders “We can…” and “We cannot…”
3) Replace ONLY that list content with the following (keep your existing layout/icons if you have them):

--- REPLACE COPY WITH THIS ---

Title (if you have one above the list):
  "Helpful Examples"

Bullets (shorter, still clear + legally safe):
  ✅ "Explain legal terms and common court steps"
  ✅ "Help you organize documents, timelines, and evidence"
  ✅ "Show general info and options (not recommendations)"
  🚫 "Tell you what to file, when to file, or what to say in court"
  🚫 "Recommend a legal strategy or predict outcomes"
  🚫 "Act as your attorney or contact the court for you"

If there’s a one-sentence lead-in above the bullets, use:
  "We provide education and organization support—so you can feel informed and prepared."

(Leave the rest of the page intact.)

================================================================================
PART B) CONTACT PAGE — fewer buttons, clearer structure, Title Case headings
================================================================================

1) Open the Contact page file:
- Look for one of these (use search):
  - client/src/pages/Contact.tsx
  - client/src/pages/contact.tsx
  - or whichever file is wired to route "/contact"

2) Replace the entire component with the code below.

PASTE THIS WHOLE FILE CONTENT (replace the file completely)
