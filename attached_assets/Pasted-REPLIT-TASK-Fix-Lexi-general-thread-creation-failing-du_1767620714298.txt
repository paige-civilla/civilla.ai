REPLIT TASK: Fix Lexi general thread creation failing due to cases FK (__general__ not present)

Problem
POST /api/lexi/threads fails with FK error:
lexi_threads.case_id references cases.id, but code inserts case_id="__general__" which is not a real case id.

Solution (correct design)
Use NULL case_id for general Lexi threads.
Keep FK constraint for real case threads. FK allows NULL.

Do ALL steps below.

A) DATABASE MIGRATION (must run on every startup via ensureSchemaMigrations)
In server/db.ts:
1) Add a new ensureLexiThreadsCaseIdNullable() migration that:
   - checks if lexi_threads.case_id is NOT NULL
   - runs:
     ALTER TABLE lexi_threads ALTER COLUMN case_id DROP NOT NULL;

2) Also ensure any default value on case_id is removed if set:
   ALTER TABLE lexi_threads ALTER COLUMN case_id DROP DEFAULT;

3) Register ensureLexiThreadsCaseIdNullable() inside ensureSchemaMigrations()
4) Add a verification log:
   [DB MIGRATION] Verification: lexi_threads.case_id nullable: true/false

B) SCHEMA CHANGE (Drizzle)
In shared/schema.ts:
1) Update lexiThreads definition so caseId is nullable:
   caseId: text("case_id").nullable()
   (keep references if currently used; references are fine with nullable)

2) Ensure insert/select types still compile.

C) STORAGE + ROUTES (stop using "__general__")
Search repo for "__general__" or LEXI_GENERAL_CASE_ID usage.

1) Replace the concept with:
   const GENERAL_CASE_ID: null = null;

2) In createLexiThread (storage + route):
   - If request is for a general thread (no caseId provided), insert case_id = null.

3) In list threads:
   - if caseId is provided: filter by caseId
   - if caseId is not provided: return only threads where case_id IS NULL
   (or allow returning both, but default should be general-only when no caseId)

4) In fetch messages / create message:
   - do NOT require a caseId for general thread
   - validate user owns the thread by userId on lexi_threads row

D) FRONTEND (LexiPanel should work without a case)
In client/src/components/lexi/LexiPanel.tsx:
1) When user is logged in but no case is selected:
   - Start conversation should call POST /api/lexi/threads with NO caseId (or caseId: null)
2) When sending a message:
   - ensure it uses activeThreadId regardless of case selection
3) Any query keys that currently include caseId should be updated so general chat uses:
   /api/lexi/threads (no case)
   /api/lexi/threads/:threadId/messages

E) CONFIRMATION TESTS
After applying, confirm:

1) POST /api/lexi/threads works when user has NO case selected
   - no 500
   - thread row has case_id = NULL
2) Messages send successfully in general chat
3) Case-specific threads still work (case_id is a real case id and FK remains valid)
4) Search repo count for "__general__" is 0 matches.

- Files changed
- Whether lexi_threads.case_id is nullable now
- Whether POST /api/lexi/threads succeeds without a case
