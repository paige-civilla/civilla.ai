TASK: Fix dark mode so it applies to ALL pages (not just Navbar)

AUTONOMY: LOW
GOAL:
Dark mode must affect the entire page (background, text, footer, all sections) across:
- Public pages (Home + marketing pages)
- App pages (/app/*)

CURRENT ISSUE:
Only Navbar updates, footer and page content stay light.

ROOT CAUSE (likely):
The `dark` class is not being applied to `document.documentElement` (html), or is applied only within Navbar scope.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT redesign sections or change copy
- Do NOT change routing
- Keep existing Civilla tokens/fonts
- Minimal file edits, only what’s necessary for theme propagation

IMPLEMENTATION:
1) Make theme toggle apply to <html> (global)
   - Locate your theme logic (likely in:
     client/src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx
     OR a theme hook/context in client/src/lib/*)

   REQUIRED behavior:
   - Store theme in localStorage (e.g., "civilla-theme" = "light" | "dark")
   - On load, apply theme to the whole document:
       document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", theme === "dark")

   Also listen to system preference ONLY if you already do; otherwise skip.

2) Ensure the page wrapper uses theme-aware background/text
   - Update BOTH layout wrappers so the whole page inherits the theme:

   Files (one or both exist; update whichever are in use):
   - client/src/components/layout/PublicLayout.tsx
   - client/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx

   Change their top-level wrapper to include:
   - min-h-screen
   - background and text that respond to `.dark`

   Use token-based classes if you have them.
   Example (choose the tokens you already use):
     className="min-h-screen bg-cream text-neutral-darkest dark:bg-neutral-darkest dark:text-cream"

   IMPORTANT:
   - The wrapper must be OUTSIDE Navbar + Footer so it affects everything.

3) Fix Footer background/text to respect theme
   File:
   - client/src/components/Footer.tsx

   Replace any hardcoded light-only background (e.g. bg-cream, bg-white)
   with a theme-aware equivalent:
     bg-cream dark:bg-neutral-darkest
   and ensure text colors also switch:
     text-neutral-darkest dark:text-cream
   Links should remain readable (add dark:hover variants only if needed).

4) Verification
   - Toggle dark mode:
     - Home page: hero sections + footer must switch
     - Plans page: cards + footer switch
     - /app pages: navbar + page background + footer switch
   - Refresh the page: theme persists
   - No console errors

DELIVERABLE:
- List exact files changed + line ranges
- Confirm dark mode now affects page + footer across all routes
